This guide helps you to learn more about the each property of `ReactiveSearch` API and explains that how to use those properties to build the query for different use-cases.

This guide is specific to the keys supported for the **OpenSearch** engine.

`ReactiveSearch API` request body can be divided into two parts, `query` and `settings`. The `query` key is an `Array` of objects where each object represents a `ReactiveSearch` query to retrieve the results. Settings(`settings`) is an optional key which can be used to control the search experience. Here is an example of the request body of `ReactiveSearch` API to get the results for which the `title` field matches with `iphone`.

```js
{
    query: [{
        id: "phone-search",
        dataField: "title",
        size: 10,
        value: "iphone"
    }],
    settings: { // optional
        recordAnalytics: true, // to enable the analytics
        enableQueryRules: true, // to enable the query rules
    }
}
```
