Already have ElasticSearch hosted with AWS, Elastic Cloud or planning to hosting it yourself?
You can now access all of Appbase.io features such as [search preview](/docs/search/Preview), [actionable analytics](/docs/analytics/Overview/) and [granular security](/docs/security/Credentials/) with an ElasticSearch cluster hosted anywhere with the `Bring Your Own Cluster` deployment mode.

> ðŸ†• We're making Appbase.io available as a cloud-native software under the codename [Arc](https://arc-dashboard.appbase.io).

This diagram highlights how Arc works. It directly interacts with an underlying ElasticSearch cluster and acts as an API gateway for clients to interact with. Arc supercharges your ElasticSearch cluster with a streamlined development experience, out of the box search analytics and fine-grained security features.

## Quickstart Recipes

You can install [Arc](https://arc-dashboard.appbase.io) on any server environment. We have created quickstart recipes to make the installation process seamless for the following platforms:

### Using Appbase.io

Appbase.io dashboard offers the most seamless experience for running your Arc with your own ElasticSearch cluster.

**Step 1 -** Go to the **[Create Cluster Link](https://dashboard.appbase.io/clusters/new/my-cluster)**. You will be redirected to sign up or login if you aren't already logged in.

![](https://i.imgur.com/X6dTO8f.png)

You should see the above screen.

**Step 2 -** Select the pricing plan. Read more about pricing plans over [here](https://arc-site.netlify.com/pricing/).

**Step 3 -** Select the region to add Arc to. It is recommended that you pick a region closest to where your ElasticSearch cluster is running.

**Step 4 -** Enter a name for your Arc instance. And enter the ElasticSearch URL. Use the `Verify Connection` button to ensure that this URL is accessible.

![](https://i.imgur.com/NO5lcvl.png)

> **Note:** We recommend either having an open ElasticSearch access policy or one based on Basic Authentication till the Arc instance is deployed.

**Step 5 -** Hit **Create Cluster** button and hang tight till your cluster is deployed.

That's all! It take around 5-10 mins for your Arc instance to be deployed. Once the deployment is complete, you will be able to see it in your **Clusters List** with a `Bring your own cluster` tag.

> **Note:** If you have IP based restriction for your cluster, now you can whitelist the Arc Cluster IP and restrict direct access to your cluster.

#### **Accessing Arc Dashboard**

Now that the Arc Cluster is deployed, we can access the **Arc Dashboard** using the **Explore Cluster** Action on the **Clusters Details** page.

![](https://i.imgur.com/uIfTi2G.png)

This will give you access to all the Appbase.io features such as:

-   Better dev tools: The Dejavu data browser, search preview, query rules
-   Actionable Search and Click Analytics
-   Fine-grained Security Permissions.

![](https://i.imgur.com/OPQiXA8.png)

#### **Accessing ElasticSearch Data using REST API**

You can access the [ElasticSearch REST](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs.html) APIs via the Arc Instance URL. You can either use the master credentials or create additional API keys with fine-grained access permissions.
![](https://i.imgur.com/Q3onHwn.png)

#### **Changing ElasticSearch URL**

You can update your ElasticSearch cluster URL at any point using the Appbase.io dashboard. All you need to do is just enter new URL and hit `Update Cluster Settings`.

> **Note:** Make sure your new ElasticSearch cluster URL has open access till the deployment is completed.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Pb2midX.png)

#### **Sharing Cluster**

With Appbase.io Dashboard you can easily share cluster with your team members. Each user can have a **Viewer** or **Admin** role.

### Using AMI

Now you can deploy Arc using Amazon Machine Image (AMI) on the AWS Marketplace. With the AMI, you can install Arc with one click on an AWS EC2 instance.

Here are the steps that you can follow to install Arc using AMI

**Step 1 -** Create an [Arc instance](/docs/hosting/BYOC/#how-to-create-arc-instance).

**Step 2 -** Select Arc AMI from [AWS Marketplace]()

// TODO Add Marketplace Link + image of marketplace

**Step 3 -** Select EC2 Instance based on your traffic for Deploying Arc. We recommend using the [t2 medium](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/) size.

That's all you need to follow in order to deploy an Arc cluster ðŸš€. Once the EC2 machine is created and _running_ successfully, you can get Public DNS / IP address from the EC2 dashboard. This URL becomes your end point for accessing the Arc services. You can also point your domain to this DNS or IP.

## ![](https://i.imgur.com/PDs8DK0.png)

> **Note:** We highly recommend using cluster with [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) certificate, as you will be using this cluster URL on [Arc Dashboard](https://arc-dashboard.appbase.io) which is secured with TLS certificate. So to avoid unsafe script errors, it is better to setup TLS for your domain or EC2 public DNS.

#### **Adding TLS Certificate**

For setting up TLS, you may also want to point EC2 public DNS to your domain. For more information on how to register/point domain to EC2 instance you can check [docs](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/get-a-domain/).

Now, let's add TLS certificate to EC2 public DNS / custom domain

**Step 1-** Get TLS certificate with `.pem` & `.key` file.

> **Note:** You can obtain a free certificate using [https://letsencrypt.org/](https://letsencrypt.org/) or even use a self-signed version.

**Step 2-** Access your EC2 instance using `ssh`. From EC2 dashboard you can select instance and click on **Connect** to get `ssh` login details about your machine.

![EC2 Connect Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/NRW1P6c.png)

**Step 3-** Copy `.pem` file content to `/etc/pki/nginx/server.crt` using `vim`/`nano` editor

```bash
# Open the file
sudo vim /etc/pki/nginx/server.crt
# Paste the code
cmd/ctrl + v
# Save the file
:wq
```

**Step 4-** Copy `.key` file content to`/etc/pki/nginx/private/server.key` using similar approach mentioned above.

**Step 5-** Open `sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`.

**Step 6-** Configuration for TLS is already present in `nginx.conf` in commented form. You can uncomment it.

-   Uncomment lines `L125` - `L213`.
-   Comment out or remove the server listening for PORT 80.

**Step 7-** Restart nginx service using following command

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

#### **Configuring Arc**

Once your EC2 machine is up and running, you can open the EC2 public DNS. You might come across following page initially.

![](https://i.imgur.com/huRzI3e.png)

You can start configuring Arc by clicking on _configure page_ link OR opening `http://public-dns/configure` URI directly.

**Step 1:** Setup Arc credentials. This are the master credentials that will be used for accessing the Arc Service from Arc Dashboard. Your initial user name is `ec2-user` and your initial password is your EC2 instance id.

![](https://i.imgur.com/OkyeFJS.png)

**Step 2:** Once you login, you can reset your username and password. Enter the your ElasticSearch URL, ARC_ID obtained while setting [Arc instance](/docs/hosting/BYOC/#how-to-create-arc-instance) and save the details.

![](https://i.imgur.com/iVmzscW.png)

Hold tight for 5-10s till the Arc service restarts with your new configurations.

#### **Getting Arc URL**

Once EC2 machine is up and running, your EC2 public DNS becomes the Arc URL. This can be used with the configured `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` to test the Arc connection.

**Example**

```bash
curl -u="USERNAME:PASSWORD" http://EC2-PUBLIC-[IP/DNS]
```

#### **Accessing Arc Dashboard**

Now that all our configurations are complete, in order to access all the Arc Services, let us sign in to the [Arc dashboard](https://arc-dashboard.appbase.io/login).

-   **Step 1 -** Sign in into [Arc dashboard](https://arc-dashboard.appbase.io/login) using your EC2 Public IP / Domain with Username and Password configured above.

![](https://i.imgur.com/qVSHx0F.png)

ðŸ”¥ Hurray! You can now start accessing all the Appbase.io services using [Arc Dashboard](https://arc-dashboard.appbase.io).

### Using Docker

We have containerized Arc with its configuring dashboard into one docker compose file. This setup enables you to run Arc with single command, i.e. `docker-compose up -d` ðŸ˜Ž.

The dockerized Arc comes with 3 different services:

#### **Arc**

Allows you to access all [Appbase.io features](https://docs.appbase.io/docs/gettingstarted/WhyAppbase/) such search preview, actionable analytics and granular security with an ElasticSearch cluster hosted anywhere.

> **Note:** Make sure your arc container has complete access to ElasticSearch.

#### **Configure**

This service comes with an intuitive UI which allows you to set your ElasticSearch cluster URL and other environment variables that are required by the Arc service.

#### **Watcher**

This service keeps an eye on the environment variable changes made by the Configure service and is responsible for restarting the Arc service.

## Quick Start ðŸš€

The steps described here assume that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) is installed on the system.

**Step 1:** Get Arc ID following the steps mentioned [here](/docs/hosting/BYOC/#how-to-create-arc-instance).

**Step 2:** Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/appbaseio/arc-dockerized.git && cd arc-dockerized
```

**Step 3:** Build and run docker containers

We highly recommend using Arc with [SSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) so that we can easily bind this with Arc Dashboard. To simplify the process of docker build and deployment, we have created three versions:

1 - Install Arc _(If you have your own Nginx / SSL setup)_

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2 - Install Arc + Nginx with TLS setup _(Recommended for production)_

-   Change the [TLS certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) and keys with production files. Please obtain your TLS certificate and key for your domain using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) or any other provider. Update the key files in [nginx/certs](https://github.com/appbaseio/arc-dockerized/tree/master/nginx/certs) directory.
-   In case you are using different name than the mentioned in [nginx/certs](https://github.com/appbaseio/arc-dockerized/tree/master/nginx/certs) directory, then update them in `docker-compose-with-tls.yaml` file as well.

![](https://i.imgur.com/piUKTLl.png)

Also, make sure you update the key file names in [nginx/default.conf](https://github.com/appbaseio/arc-dockerized/blob/master/nginx/default.conf) file.

![](https://i.imgur.com/LW8zOyB.png)

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-with-tls.yaml up -d
```

3 - Install Arc + ElasticSearch _(If you want to deploy Arc Along with ElasticSearch)_

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-with-elasticsearch.yaml up -d
```

ðŸ”¥ Thats all, our containers should be up and running. Next, let us configure the environment variables required by the Arc service.

**Step 4:** Open the configuration service URL in your browser, http://localhost:8080.

> **Note:** If you are running this setup on an virtual machine, make sure port `8080` is accessible in your inbound rules from the environment where you are running it from.

**Step 5:** Set credentials

![](https://i.imgur.com/huRzI3e.png)

**Step 6:** Configure ElasticSearch URL and ARC ID obtained above.

![](https://i.imgur.com/iVmzscW.png)

> **Note:** Once you save the configuration, it may take 5-10s to restart the arc service.

**Step 7:** Start using Arc Services using [Arc Dashboard](https://arc-dashboard.appbase.io/). Here you will have to input the Cluster URL. It should be either http://localhost:8000, http://my-ip:8000 or https://my-domain depending on how and where you're running Arc. The credentials would be the same as configured in _Step 5_.

> **Note:** The Arc service is exposed via port `8000`, so make sure port `8000` is set in your inbound rules for the cluster. Also, we highly recommend using Arc with TLS certificate.
