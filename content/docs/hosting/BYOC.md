Already have ElasticSearch hosted with AWS, Elastic Cloud or hosting it yourself?
You can now access all of [Appbase.io](https://arc-site.netlify.com) features like [search preview](/docs/search/Preview), [actionable analytics](/docs/analytics/Overview/) and [granular security](/docs/security/Credentials/) with any ElasticSearch cluster hosted anywhere with our `Bring Your Own Cluster` deployment mode.

> ðŸ†• We're making Appbase.io available as a cloud-native software under the codename [Arc](https://arc-site.netlify.com).

This diagram highlights how Arc works. It directly interacts with an underlying ElasticSearch cluster and acts as an API gateway for clients to interact with. Arc supercharges your ElasticSearch cluster with a streamlined development experience, out of the box search analytics and fine-grained security features.

## Quickstart Recipes

You can install [Arc](https://arc-site.netlify.com) on any server environment. We have created quickstart recipes to make the installation process seamless for the following platforms:

### Using Appbase.io

Appbase.io dashboard offers the most seamless experience for running your Arc with your own ElasticSearch cluster.

**Step 1 -** Go to the **[Create Cluster Link](https://dashboard.appbase.io/clusters/new/my-cluster)**. You will be redirected to sign up or login if you aren't already logged in.

![](https://i.imgur.com/X6dTO8f.png)

You should see the above screen.

**Step 2 -** Select the pricing plan. Read more about pricing plans over [here](https://arc-site.netlify.com/pricing/).

**Step 3 -** Select the region to add Arc to. It is recommended that you pick a region closest to where your ElasticSearch cluster is running.

**Step 4 -** Enter a name for your Arc instance. And enter the ElasticSearch URL. Use the `Verify Connection` button to ensure that this URL is accessible.

![](https://i.imgur.com/NO5lcvl.png)

> **Note:** We recommend either having an open ElasticSearch access policy or one based on Basic Authentication till the Arc instance is deployed.

**Step 5 -** Hit **Create Cluster** button and hang tight till your cluster is deployed.

That's all! It take around 5-10 mins for your Arc instance to be deployed. Once the deployment is complete, you will be able to see it in your **Clusters List** with a `Bring your own cluster` tag.

> **Note:** If you have IP based restriction for your cluster, now you can whitelist the Arc Cluster IP and restrict direct access to your cluster.

#### **Accessing Arc Dashboard**

Now that the Arc Cluster is deployed, we can access the **Arc Dashboard** using the **Explore Cluster** Action on the **Clusters Details** page.

![](https://i.imgur.com/uIfTi2G.png)

This will give you access to all the Appbase.io features such as:
-   Better dev tools: The Dejavu data browser, search preview, query rules
-   Actionable Search and Click Analytics
-   Fine-grained Security Permissions.

![](https://i.imgur.com/OPQiXA8.png)

#### **Accessing ElasticSearch Data using REST API**

You can access the [ElasticSearch REST](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs.html) APIs via the Arc Instance URL. You can either use the master credentials or create additional API keys with fine-grained access permissions.
![](https://i.imgur.com/Q3onHwn.png)

#### **Changing ElasticSearch URL**

You can update your ElasticSearch cluster URL at any point using the Appbase.io dashboard. All you need to do is just enter new URL and hit `Update Cluster Settings`.

> **Note:** Make sure your new ElasticSearch cluster URL has open access till the deployment is completed.

### Using AMI

Arc is also available via an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) on the AWS Marketplace. Arc works running a `systemd` service. With the AMI, you can seamlessly deploy Arc on an AWS EC2 instance.

Before Creating an AWS EC2 Machine using AMI, let's create an [Arc instance](https://arc-dashboard.appbase.io/install) which will give us access to [Arc Dashboard](https://arc-dashboard.appbase.io).

Here are the steps that you can follow to deploy Get Arc ID:

-   **Step 1 -** Go to [Arc Dashboard](https://arc-dashboard.appbase.io/install).

![](https://i.imgur.com/YZubabh.png)

-   **Step 2 -** Enter your email address

-   **Step 3 -** You will receive an OTP on entered email address. Enter OTP to verify the email address

-   **Step 4-** You will receive an email with `ARC_ID` which we can use while creating EC2 machine.

Here are the steps that you can follow to install Arc Middleware using AMI

**Step 1 -** Select ARC [Amazon Machine Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) from AWS Marketplace

// TODO Add Marketplace Link + image of marketplace

**Step 2 -** Select EC2 Instance Type required for Deploying Arc. We recommend using `t2 medium`.

**Step 3 -** Enter env variables in `User Data` Section while configuring `EC2` instance. Here is sample script which you can enter in `User Data` Section.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#!/bin/bash
echo ES_CLUSTER_URL='https://search-test.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com' >> /etc/systemd/system/arc.env

echo USERNAME='admin' >> /etc/systemd/system/arc.env
echo PASSWORD='admin' >> /etc/systemd/system/arc.env
echo ARC_ID='YOUR ARC ID' >> /etc/systemd/system/arc.env
```

#### **Environment Variables**

| **Variable**             | **Description**                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ES_CLUSTER_URL`         | ElasticSearch Cluster URL                                                                                                                             |
| `USERNAME`               | Username used for Basic Auth with ARC Cluster URL                                                                                                     |
| `PASSWORD`               | Password used for Basic Auth with ARC Cluster URL                                                                                                     |
| `JWT_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY_LOC` | When Role Based Access control is used for security. This Env helps in specifying the location of public key file that is used for verifying location |
| `JWT_ROLE_KEY`           | Field used for getting the role from JWT token.                                                                                                       |
| `ARC_ID`                 | Used for accessing the Arc Dashboard (This is to be set once the Arc Middleware is deployed and you have signed up for arc dashboard)                 |

> **Note:** Make sure ElasticSearch cluster URL is open till the deployment is completed so that we can Verify ElasticSearch cluster.

#### **Getting Arc URL**

Once the EC2 machine is created successfully, you can get Public DNS / IP address from the EC2 dashboard. This can be used with `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` to access ElasticSearch data using Arc.

![](https://i.imgur.com/PDs8DK0.png)

**Example**

```bash
curl -u="USERNAME:PASSWORD" http://EC2-PUBLIC-[IP/DNS]
```

You can also point your domain to EC2 instance in order to access data using your domain. For more information on how to register/point domain to EC2 instance you can check [docs](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/get-a-domain/).

#### **Accessing Arc Dashboard**

Alright now in order to access all the Arc Services, let us Sign in to [Arc dashboard](https://arc-dashboard.appbase.io/login) and start accessing data from there.

-   **Step 1 -** Sign in into [Arc dashboard](https://arc-dashboard.appbase.io/login) using your EC2 Public Domains / Domain with Username and Password set in the ENV

![](https://i.imgur.com/qVSHx0F.png)

And we are ready with our Arc Setup using AMI from AWS marketplace.

#### **Changing Environment Variables**

In order to update any environment variable here, you need to do `ssh` login into your EC2 machine. You can connect with EC2 machine via `ssh` using `.pem` key file that you must created / used while configure and creating and EC2 using Arc AMI.

You can click on **Connect** button from EC2 Dashboard and see the instructions to do ssh connection.

![](https://i.imgur.com/cS8LKkF.png)

Now in order to change Environment variables, please follow this steps

-   **Step 1 -** Connect via `SSH`

```bash
ssh -i "test.pem" ec2-user@ec2-1-2-3-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

-   **Step 2 -** Open `/etc/systemd/system/arc.env` file using VIM editor with root permissions

```bash
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/arc.env
```

-   **Step 3 -** Edit / Add Variables and save the file.

-   **Step 4 -** Restart Arc Service

```bash
systemctl restart arc
```

### Using Docker

[Arc](https://arc-site.netlify.com) is available as Docker Image as well, which can easily help you deploy and get started with your current docker based infrastructure. Based on your ElasticSearch version you can get a docker image and run it with required [Environment Variables](/docs/hosting/BringYourOwnCluster/#environment-variables).

#### **Available Docker Images**

// TODO Add correct images links

| **ElasticSearch Version** | **Docker Image** |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| ElasticSearch V7          | Docker Image     |

Before Deploying Arc Image, let's create an [Arc instance](https://arc-dashboard.appbase.io/install) which will give us access to [Arc Dashboard](https://arc-dashboard.appbase.io).

Here are the steps that you can follow to deploy Get Arc ID:

-   **Step 1 -** Go to [Arc Dashboard](https://arc-dashboard.appbase.io/login) and Select [Install A New Arc Instance](https://arc-dashboard.appbase.io/install)

![](https://i.imgur.com/YZubabh.png)

-   **Step 2 -** Enter your email address

-   **Step 3 -** You will receive an OTP on entered email address. Enter OTP to verify the email address

-   **Step 4-** You will receive an email with `ARC_ID` which we can use while creating deploying Arc Image on Docker Container.

#### **Deploying Arc Docker Image**

-   **Step 1 -** Pull docker image

```bash
docker pull appbaseio/arc:DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSION
```

-   **Step 2 -** Create file with [Environment Variables](/docs/hosting/BringYourOwnCluster/#environment-variables)

Sample `env` file

```bash
# env

ES_CLUSTER_URL=http://elasticsearch:9200

USERNAME=foo
PASSWORD=bar
ARC_ID=YOUR ARC ID
```

> **Note:** Make sure your docker container can access ElasticSearch cluster.

-   **Step 3 -** Run Docker container

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name arc -p 8000:8000 --net=arc --env-file=env appbaseio/arc:DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSION
```

-   **Step 4 -** Expose your Arc service with public URL

-   **Step 5 -** Follow steps listed [here](/docs/hosting/BringYourOwnCluster/#accessing-arc-dashboard-1) to access Arc Dashboard. Only difference here will be instead of AWS EC2 url it will be public URL that you have exposed your container with.
