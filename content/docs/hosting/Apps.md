An **App** in appbase.io is equivalent to an index in ElasticSearch. Appbase.io Apps allow you to get the best of Elasticsearch without the cost of running a full cluster. You can read more about them over [here](https://appbase.io/apps/).

In addition to being powered by ElasticSearch, apps come with the following features out of the box:

-   A dashboard UI for importing data,
-   Build and test search relevancy with zero lines of code,
-   Get Actionable Search Analytics: Top User Searches, 
-   Enhanced security with ACLs, IP sources and HTTP Referers, Role Based Access Control, and IP based rate limits.


## Getting Started

Here are the steps you can follow to create and manage Appbase.io apps.

-   **Step 3 -** Enter details and click **Create App** button.
    > **Note:** Here you can select the plan based on API calls and storage requirements. It also allows you to import data from JSON/CSV. Data can also be imported after the app is created.

That's all! Our appbase.io app is created ðŸš€. Now you can view this app on your dashboard by clicking on the app card.
