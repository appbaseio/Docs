[ReactiveSearch's cloud service](https://www.reactivesearch.io/pricing) provides a fully hosted Elasticsearch + ReactiveSearch experience in over 16+ global regions. It's the easiest way to get started with ReactiveSearch. The cloud service comes with the following benefits over a [bring your cluster](/docs/hosting/byoc/) option:

  - **A zero config app search experience**: With the cloud service, appbase.io deploys both Elasticsearch and appbase.io services in a performance-optimized fashion,
  - **16+ available regions**: Deploy your cluster in one of 16+ global regions on GCP or AWS,
  - **99.9% SLA**: Get 99.9% SLAs on all of our production plans,
  - **Monitoring**: See detailed insights into cluster health and resource usage.


## Getting started

Following are the steps that you can follow, to create a new cluster:

-   Login to [ReactiveSearch dashboard](https://dashboard.reactivesearch.io/)
    <br/>

     <div style="border: 1px solid #dfdfdf; border-radius: 5px;overflow:hidden"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/m8my8lq3keju99c/Screenshot%202019-08-08%2015.57.03.png?raw=1" alt="cluster creation gif" style="width:100%;" /></div>

-   Go to [cluster pages](https://dashboard.reactivesearch.io/clusters) and click [Create New Cluster](https://dashboard.reactivesearch.io/clusters/new). Enter the following details for cluster creation:

    -   Select a plan. You can check out the pricing plan details over [here](https://reactivesearch.io/pricing).

    -   Input the desired name for cluster.

    -   Select Elasticsearch flavour, i.e. [Open Source Elasticsearch Distribution](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) or [OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch).

    -   Optionally, add Kibana or OpenSearch Dashboards for search visualization.


## Tracking Deployment Status

Once the cluster creation starts, it takes around 5-10 minutes for a cluster to be up and running. There is a status tag next to cluster name on your cluster dashboard, which will help you know the status of deployment.

<div style="border: 1px solid #dfdfdf; border-radius: 5px;overflow:hidden;margin-top:10px;"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hm0lqxllzwe50kk/Screenshot%202019-08-08%2018.37.08.png?raw=1" alt="cluster creation gif" style="width:100%;" /></div>

Once the cluster is created and Elasticsearch is deployed successfully, you will be able to **View Details** of the cluster.

There you might come across messages which specifies that other addon deployments are still in progress. For accessing all the features, you can wait till all the _deployment in progress_ messages disappear.

<div style="border: 1px solid #dfdfdf; border-radius: 5px;overflow:hidden;margin-top:10px;"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mw5sg478mtwwg9q/Screenshot%202019-08-08%2018.44.26.png?raw=1" alt="cluster creation gif" style="width:100%;" /></div>

## Managing A Deployed Elasticsearch Cluster

Once the cluster is deployed, you can maintain cluster by

-   Manage deployment details
-   Access the dashboard UI where you can:
    - Import data
    - Set and test search relevancy
    - See actionable analytics
    - Set and manage access control settings
-   Scale cluster
-   Share cluster
-   Monitor resource usage with the Cluster Monitoring view

### Managing add-ons

Once the cluster is deployed you can enable / disable the addons from Cluster details page.

<div style="border: 1px solid #dfdfdf; border-radius: 5px;overflow:hidden;margin-top:10px;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Md3cXNf.png" alt="addons editing" /></div>

### Accessing ReactiveSearch GUI Dashboard

In order to access and manage cluster data, you can click on **Explore Cluster** from cluster details page.

<div style="border: 1px solid #dfdfdf; border-radius: 5px;overflow:hidden;margin-top:10px;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/d2GCCWH.png" alt="explore" /></div>

Using this Dashboard you can create/delete indexes or you can explore and manage their individual data. Appbase.io GUI Dashboard also allows you to manage [API credentials](/docs/security/credentials/) and [Role Based Access](/docs/security/role/), hence adding more layers of security to your application.

<div style="border: 1px solid #dfdfdf; border-radius: 5px;overflow:hidden;margin-top:10px;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4LJxa6U.png" /></div>

> Note: For more details on how [analytics](/docs/analytics/overview/) and [security](/docs/security/credentials/) works please check their individual documentation.

### Scaling Cluster

At any given point you can scale the cluster by adding/removing Elasticsearch nodes.

<div style="border: 1px solid #dfdfdf; border-radius: 5px;overflow:hidden;margin-top:10px;"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bm2ohlvwlu7ez6y/Screenshot%202019-08-08%2018.48.58.png?raw=1" alt="cluster creation gif" style="width:100%;" /></div>

### Sharing Cluster

With the help of Sharing feature you can share cluster access with your team and can also restrict the access by specifying the `viewer` role to that team member.

 <div style="border: 1px solid #dfdfdf; border-radius: 5px;overflow:hidden;margin-top:10px;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ce4q4g6.png" /></div>

A more fine-grained access control mechanism is available as part of the [User Management view](/docs/security/user-management/) under the Explore Cluster GUI.

### Monitor Cluster
