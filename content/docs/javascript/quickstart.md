[appbase-js](https://github.com/appbaseio/appbase-js) is a universal JavaScript client library for working with the appbase.io database.  

It can:

* Index new documents or update / delete existing ones.
* Stream updates to documents, queries or filters over ``websockets``.
* Work universally on Node.JS, Browser, and React Native.

It can't:  

* Configure mappings, change analyzers, or capture snapshots. All these are provided by [elasticsearch.js](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/index.html) - the official ElasticSearch JS client library.

[Appbase.io - the database service](https://appbase.io) is opinionated about cluster setup and hence doesn't support the ElasticSearch devops APIs. See (rest.appbase.io)[https://rest.appbase.io] for a full reference on the supported APIs.

This is a quick start guide to whet the appetite with the possibilities of data streams.

## Creating an App

![](https://i.imgur.com/r6hWKAG.gif)

Log in to <span class="fa fa-external-link"></span> [appbase.io dashboard](https://dashboard.appbase.io/), and create a new app.

For this tutorial, we will use an app called `newstreamingapp`. The credentials for this app are `meqRf8KJC:65cc161a-22ad-40c5-aaaf-5c082d5dcfda`.

> appbase.io uses **HTTP Basic Auth**, a widely used protocol for a username:password based authentication.

## Install appbase-js

We will fetch and install the **appbase-js** lib using npm. ``v2.3.0`` is the most current version.

```js
npm install appbase-js
```

Adding it in the browser should be a one line script addition.

```html
<script src="node_modules/appbase-js/dist/appbase.js.gz"></script>
```

Alternatively, a UMD build of the library can be used directly from either  [CDN.js](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/appbase-js) or [jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/appbase-js/dist/).

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/appbase-js/2.3.0/appbase.js"></script>
```

To write data or stream updates from [appbase.io](https://appbase.io), we need to first create a reference object. We do this by passing the appbase.io API URL, app name, and credentials into the ``Appbase`` constructor:

```js
var appbaseRef = new Appbase({
	url: "https://scalr.api.appbase.io",
	app: "newstreamingapp",
	credentials: "meqRf8KJC:65cc161a-22ad-40c5-aaaf-5c082d5dcfda"
})

```

**OR**

```js
var appbaseRef = new Appbase({
	url: "https://meqRf8KJC:65cc161a-22ad-40c5-aaaf-5c082d5dcfda@scalr.api.appbase.io",
	app: "newstreamingapp"
})
```

Credentials can also be directly passed as a part of the API URL.



## Storing Data

Once we have the reference object (called ``appbaseRef`` in this tutorial), we can insert any JSON object into it with the ``index()`` method.


```js
var jsonObject = {
	"department_name": "Books",
	"department_name_analyzed": "Books",
	"department_id": 1,
	"name": "A Fake Book on Network Routing",
	"price": 5595
}
```
```js
appbaseRef.index({
	type: "books",
	id: "X1",
	body: jsonObject
}).on('data', function(response) {
	console.log(response);
}).on('error', function(error) {
	console.log(error);
})
```

where ``type: 'books'`` indicate the collection (or table) inside which the data will be stored and the``id: '1'`` is an optional unique identifier.

The ``index()`` method (and all the other ``appbase`` methods) return a [stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable) object. A 'data' event handler can be used on the returned object (or in a chained fashion) for listening to all the data changes.

> Note <span class="fa fa-info-circle"></span>
>
> appbase.io uses the same APIs and data modeling conventions as [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch). A **type** is equivalent to a collection in MongoDB or a table in SQL, and a **document** is similar to the document in MongoDB and equivalent to a row in SQL.

## GETing or Streaming Data

Unlike typical databases that support GET operations (or Read) for fetching data and queries, Appbase.io operates on both GET and stream modes.

### Getting a Document Back

Now that we are able to store data, let's try to get the data back from [appbase.io](https://appbase.io) with the ``get()`` method.

```js
appbaseRef.get({
	type: "books",
	id: "X1"
}).on('data', function(response) {
	console.log(response)
}).on('error', function(error) {
	console.log(error)
})

/* get() response */
{
	"_index": "newstreamingapp",
	"_type": "books",
	"_id": "X1",
	"_version": 5,
	"found": true,
	"_source": {
		"department_name": "Books",
		"department_name_analyzed": "Books",
		"department_id": 1,
		"name": "A Fake Book on Network Routing",
		"price": 5595
	}
}
```

Even though ``get()`` returns a single document data, appbase.io returns it as a stream object with the 'data' event handler.

### Subscribing to a Document Stream

Let's say that we are interested in subscribing to all the state changes that happen on a document. Here, we would use the ``getStream()`` method over ``get()``, which keeps returning new changes made to the document.

```js
appbaseRef.getStream({
	type: "books",
	id: "X1"
}).on('data', function(response) {
	console.log("new document update: ", response)
}).on('error', function(error) {
	console.log("getStream() failed with: ", error)
});
```

Don't be surprised if you don't see anything printed, ``getStream()`` only returns when new updates are made to the document.

### Observe the updates in realtime

Let's see live updates in action. We will modify the book price in our original ``jsonObject`` variable from 5595 to 6034 and apply ``index()`` again.

For brevity, we will not show the ``index()`` operation here.

```js
/* getStream() response */
{
	"_type": "books",
	"_id": "X1",
	"_source": {
		"department_id": 1,
		"department_name": "Books",
		"department_name_analyzed": "Books",
		"name": "A Fake Book on Network Routing",
		"price": 6034
	}
}
```

In the new document update, we can see the price change (5595 -> 6034) being reflected. Subsequent changes will be streamed as JSON objects.

``Note:`` Appbase always streams the final state of an object, and not the diff b/w the old state and the new state. You can compute diffs on the client side by persisting the state using a composition of (\_type, \_id) fields.


## Streaming Rich Queries

Streaming document updates are great for building messaging systems or notification feeds on individual objects. What if we were interested in continuously listening to a broader set of data changes? The ``searchStream()`` method scratches this itch perfectly.

In the example below, we will see it in action with a ``match_all`` query that returns any time a new document is added to the type 'books' or when any of the existing documents are modified.

```js
appbaseRef.searchStream({
	type: "books",
	body: {
		query: {
			match_all: {}
		}
	}
}).on('data', function(response) {
	console.log("searchStream(), new match: ", response);
}).on('error', function(error) {
	console.log("caught a searchStream() error: ", error)
})

/* Response when a new data matches */
{
	"_type": "books",
	"_id": "X1",
	"_version": 5,
	"found": true,
	"_source": {
		"department_name": "Books",
		"department_name_analyzed": "Books",
		"department_id": 1,
		"name": "A Fake Book on Network Routing",
		"price": 6034
	}
}
```

``Note:`` Like ``getStream()``, ``searchStream()`` subscribes to the new matches. For fetching existing search results, check out [``search()``](/javascript/api-reference.html#search).

**v0.10.0** introduces a new method [``searchStreamToURL()``](/javascript/api-reference.html#searchstreamtourl) that streams results directly to a URL instead of streaming back.

In this tutorial, we have learnt how to index new data and stream both individual data and results of an expressive query.
