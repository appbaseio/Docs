Webhooks (aka streaming to a URL) allows you to set up integrations which respond to events in appbase.io. Webhooks can be used to send transaction emails, post on a slack channel when a new user signs up, update the pricing plan when the data storage crosses a threshold.

## How webhooks are triggered

Webhooks are continuous queries whose results are subscribed by a URL. A webhooks object contains 1) continuous query and 2) subscribed URL's configurations (headers, body payload, count, interval).

Webhooks can be triggered when a new document is inserted, an existing document changes it's value, or when a new document matches a specific continuous query condition.


## Composing Webhooks Queries

Since registering a webhook is a method of the ``Appbase`` object, we will start with instantiating an Appbase object.

```js
var appbaseRef = Appbase({
  url: 'https://RIvfxo1u1:dee8ee52-8b75-4b5b-be4f-9df3c364f59f@scalr.api.appbase.io',
  appname: 'createnewtestapp01'
 })
 ```

Webhooks in appbase-js are supported by [``searchStreamToURL()``](javascript/api-reference.html#searchstreamtourl). The behavior is very similar to  [``searchStream()``](javascript/api-reference.html#searchstream), where the results are subscribed via a streams interface. Instead of subscribing the results back to the user, webhooks subscribe them to a URL.

 ```js
 appbaseRef.searchStreamToURL(
 {
    type: 'tweet',
    body: {
      query: {
        match_all: {}
      }
    }
 }, {
    url: "http://requestb.in/v0mz3hv0?inspect",
    interval: 60
 }, function(res) {
     console.log("webhook successfully registered: ", res);
 });
 ```

Here, we set the webhook request to be sent every time there is a document insert in the ``type`` tweet. To control for the noise, we set the ``interval`` to 60s.

### Modifying a Webhook's URL

The ``searchStreamToURL()`` method returns a stream object with a method ``change()`` which can be used to change the webhook's subscribed URL for the original continuous query.

```js
appbaseRef.searchStreamToURL(
 {
    type: 'tweet',
    body: {
      query: {
        match_all: {}
      }
    }
 }, {
    url: "http://requestb.in/v0mz3hv0",
    interval: 60
 }, function(res) {
    console.log("webhook successfully registered: ", res);
    this.change({
      url: "http://mockbin.org/bin/0844bdda-24f6-4589-a45b-a2139d2ccc84",
      interval: 60
    });
 });
```

``change(object)`` method accepts a URL object which completely replaces the previous URL object.

### Deregistering the Webhook Query

The ``searchStreamToURL()`` method returns a stream object with a method ``stop()`` which deletes the webhook query.

```js
appbaseRef.searchStreamToURL(
 {
    type: 'tweet',
    body: {
      query: {
        match_all: {}
      }
    }
 }, {
    url: "http://requestb.in/v0mz3hv0",
    interval: 60
 }, function(res) {
    console.log("webhook successfully registered: ", res);
    this.stop().on('data', function(res) {
      console.log("webhook successfully stopped: ", res);
    });
 });
```

``stop()`` method deletes the webhook query. It's important to call this method only after the webhook is successfully registered.

## Adding Dynamic Data in Webhooks

Webhooks in appbase.io are designed for configurability.

1. Supports [mustache syntax](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) in the body payload where the body can be a JSON or a raw string,
2. Supports ``interval`` to send a webhook request only after a certain time interval (controls for noise),
3. Supports ``count`` to send a fixed number of webhook requests before de-registering the URL.

Together, these three features allow for a very versatile webhooks streaming. In this doc, we will look at composing webhook queries and a number of different usage scenarios for webhooks.

### Mustache Syntax

One of the biggest uses of webhooks is sending transaction notifications, like sending an email or a push notification within the app. We support Mustache syntax for enabling sending dynamic data in webhook request's body payload.



```js
{
  "tweet": {
      "msg": "#Expanse is one of the best TV space opera after firefly #scifi",
      "tags": ["Expanse", "scifi"],
      "by": "@siddharthlatest",
      "timestamp": 14224544242
  }
}
```

---------------------------------------
 Mustache   | Rendered   | Note(s)   
------------|------------|-----------
{{{_source}}} | {"tweet": {"msg": "#Expanse has to be one of the best television space opera after firefly #scifi", "tags": ["Expanse", "scifi"], "by": "@siddharthlatest", "timestamp": 14224544242}} | Renders the entire data JSON
{{#tweet}}{{timestamp}}{{/tweet}} | 14224544242   | Renders the nested property inside tweet
{{#tweet}}{{tags}}{{/tweet}} | ["Expanse", "scifi"]  Renders the nested array inside the tweet object
