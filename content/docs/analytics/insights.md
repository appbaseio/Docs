### Each Insight Explained
Let us explain the most important insights and their purposes.

#### No Results Searches
This insight helps you to find how many searches have been performed by users for which you have no results. A higher value for no result searches is not a good sign for business because you may lose customers traction.

#### Low Clicks
Low clicks mean that people are not finding the exact thing for which they're searching.

#### Low Suggestions Clicks
If you have low suggestions clicks then it indicates that your search is not showing relevant suggestions to the users.

#### Higher Click Position
If the click position is higher than it means that your users are having difficulty finding the desired results at the top.

#### Popular Searches
This insight helps you to find the total number of popular searches made by users. A higher value indicates that your business is doing really well.

#### Popular Searches with Low Clicks
If something is popular among users but you're not getting clicks then it means that your results for popular searches are not relevant.

#### Long Tail Searches
Long-tail searches insight represents that users have to type more to search the results i.e the suggestions which you're showing in search are not much useful.

#### Higher Bounce Rate
The bounce rate represents how many users are visiting your search page and leaving it without interacting with the search. Higher bounce insight is reported when the bounce rate becomes more than 50%. 

#### High Response Time
If you see that insight then it means that you're search is slow and required some additional infrastructure.

#### Client-side Errors
Client-side errors indicate that your search requests are getting failed because of bad requests from the client-side.

#### Server Errors
Internal server errors indicate an issue with the underlying Elasticsearch service.
