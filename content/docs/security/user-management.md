User Management allows you to add additional user login access to the appbase.io dashboard. You can access User Management from the `Security` view in your dashboard.

Users need to sign in via the login URL provided in the dashboard using the provided username and password. Passwords are encrypted and can't be seen once set.

## Create A New User

When creating a new user, you can either provide admin privileges or set the specific scopes for actions that this user can take via the UI or APIs. Please read about each scope and its privileges carefully before granting access to the user.

- **Develop** scope users can access Elasticsearch APIs. For example, they can do the following actions:
    - Create/delete indices
    - Import data to any index
    - Browse data
    - Access request logs

- **Curated Insights** scope users can access the `Curated Insights` view in `dashboard` to subscribe to appbase.io curated insights. You can read more about it [here](/docs/analytics/curated-insights/).


- **Access Control** users can access the [API Credentials](/docs/security/credentials/), [Role Based Access Control](/docs/security/role/) and [Node Sync Preferences](/docs/security/node-sync-preferences/) views.

- **User Management** scope users can do the following actions:
    - Create new users,
    - Edit existing users. For example, modify the privileges of other users,
    - Delete the existing users.

- **Billing** scope allows access to the `Billing` page in dashboard. A user with this scope can add / edit payment methods and make changes to the subscription.

- **Downtime Alerts** In case of service downtime, appbase.io send emails to all the users with the `Downtime Alerts` scope.


## User Management vs API Credentials

When you need to provide GUI access to the dashboard, we recommend creating a new user. On the other hand, when you need to offer programmatic access to a subset of the APIs or set restrictions based on IPs, HTTP Referers, fields, time, we recommend creating an [API credential](/docs/security/credentials/).
