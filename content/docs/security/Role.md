## Why Role Based Access Control System?

Prior to this, appbase.io apps can be secured using [HTTP Basic Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) based API Credentials that only had read access and additional restrictive ACL settings. But that came with the downside of exposing the API credentials publicly. To reduce the vulnerability of data being hacked or misused, we also introduced IP limits which adds more security against network spoofing and un-necessary API calls. However for sensitive data, users had to rely on a backend service that would authorize client requests.

We observed that in majority of the scenarios, our users would use an Identity Provider (think Firebase Auth, Auth0, PassPort.JS) to know their users and then maintain a map of what credentials got assigned to these users. The Role Based Access Control UI allows users to do this from the appbase.io dashboard and completely eliminates the need for a separate backend service.

## What is Role Based Access Control?

In general “Role Based Access Control” is an approach to restricting system access based on roles and privileges. Essential entities in any [Role Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) system are

-   The **user** trying to access the system,
-   The **service** that user wants to access (in our case _appbase.io application / elasticsearch indexes_)
-   The **[identity provider (IdP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider)**.

To access the service, the user first needs to authenticate against the IdP. The IdP verifies the user credentials and hands out a signed token. The user then sends this token to the service with each request. The service uses the information in the token to verify the user’s identity and to assign roles and permissions.

You can now secure your Appbase.io applications by providing role based access to the various users that are going to use appbase application / elasticsearch index. We are supporting role base access using [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/introduction/).

> JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

## Key Benefits of Using Role-Based Access System:

-   API Credentials are not exposed anymore, thus making your data less vulnerable.
-   With each user login, there will be a unique JWT created for authenticating the user. A JWT can also be set to expire with a TTL. This drastically limits the attack vector.
-   Lower latency as a result of not needing an extra backend service call.
-   If you already use an Identity Provider (that operate using JWTs), you can integrate them directly into appbase.io.
-   You can map user roles (encoded in a JWT) to API credentials in appbase.io. API credentials already allow a rich set of configurability: Read/Write Access, Granular ACLs, Field whitelist / blacklist, IP Rate Limits, IP source filtering and HTTP Referers.

## How does it work?

![how it works](https://i.imgur.com/Imx0wiG.png)

As the administrator of the app, you need to provide [PKCS1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_1) Public Key that can be used for verifying the integrity of incoming JWTs. When a user logs in to your app, a unique token is created for the user and is subsequently passed to appbase.io API calls for the duration of their login session. When the appbase.io service receives the token from a client, it first verifies its integrity using the public key provided by the app admin and then maps it to the API credential set for the role attribute present in the JWT.

Popular hosted OAuth & Identity Providers like [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth), [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/), [Okta](https://www.okta.com/), [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) all use JWTs and can be integrated with appbase.io RBAC. Open source libraries / frameworks for authentication like [PassportJS](http://www.passportjs.org/docs/oauth/) for NodeJS, [Goth](https://github.com/markbates/goth) for GoLang, and [AuthLib](https://github.com/lepture/authlib/) for Python can also be used.

## Enable Role Based Access using Dashboard

[Appbase.io dashboard](https://dashboard.appbase.io) provides an intuitive way to enable and configure role based access. In order to setup RBAC, select _Role Based Access_ under _Security_ on the Dashboard's navigation bar.

> **NOTE** RBAC feature is available with all the paid plans.

### This page is divided into 2 sections

#### 1. Configuring JWT Public Key and Role Claim

In order to verify JWT signed using RSA256, we need a Public Key provided by the identity provider. Public key must be [PEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail) encoded [PKCS1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_1).

You can start by pasting the public key in the text area provided for _Public Key_. Another thing that is required to verify user role, is actual _Role Claim_ that would be present in any JWT. _Role Claim_ is Key in JWT Object that helps
in asserting the role information. This can be configured in _Role Claim_ input. The default value for Role Claim is `role`.

**Here is a quick example, using [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/) debugger.**

#### 2. Mapping roles to [API Credentials](/docs/security/credentials)

Once the _Public Key_ and _Role Claim_ is configured, you can set up the actual roles that a user can have in your application in **Map Roles to API Credential** section. Each credentials created in [API Credentials](/docs/security/credentials) section can have a unique role name, which would be the value encoded in our JWT.

As you can see in the above example we have assigned roles to different credentials, i.e. `admin` & `developer`. (_this values have to be unique per application_).

Now, whenever a user will make a request to the application with valid `JWT Bearer` token for a given application, they will be able to access the data as per their authorization role.

Here's a sample API call to get data using this

```bash
curl --location --request GET "https://scalr.api.appbase.io/my-appbase-app" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Impob24iLCJyb2xlIjoiYWRtaW4ifQ.GEbnh5dfbdRXdlkGi5aLFnM7xYuYViPSf0ZnLGaX0ikfo3fT8Rtx7rbpKvR6_eftmB3q0Q_x3n9-JsgbEY1E47p2H_qhMhP5Jd8uB__Dlm1LW5W6qiDsNelVsZLAcqq-CgnGxkgWvWRFfpNEoyZhzLa3TudoPjZWW7m4WOaewpyZwlyGH7oztjbLVwRVCNC5ziA61aZJHVR-C4MhaMxZ-hf1uE022BD9q6aH-mWuVjbMACMOQuqTgIxo5tmphRh_kbuKZEUslUYtB1cEPzgQNU2eRq5BjDI4EoxdTKkLhgYSgMWNnUcZowq8sd4-kKjEB7wrUa6xYIjY04xVO4NvYw"
