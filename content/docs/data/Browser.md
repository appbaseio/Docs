Data Browser is a WYSIWYG GUI for adding, modifying and viewing your appbase.io app's data.

Data is stored as JSON documents. You can read more about the data schema [here](/docs/data/Model).

## Installation

The data browser is available within appbase.io app dashboard. But it can also be:

-   downloaded as a [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dejavu/jopjeaiilkcibeohjdmejhoifenbnmlh),
-   run as a [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/appbaseio/dejavu) or
-   used as a hosted app [here](https://opensource.appbase.io/dejavu/live).

## Creating An App

You can go to the [appbase.io dashboard](https://dashboard.appbase.io) and create an app. In the below GIF, we create an app called `demostreamingapp`.

## Adding Your First Data

You can access the databrowser [from the dashboard](https://dashboard.appbase.io/app?view=browse) or independently via [dejavu app](https://dejavu.appbase.io).

Follow the above steps to add your first data.

## Adding New Field

Dejavu now also supports adding new fields, including setting the appropriate mappings for the field.

You have to first be in the **Editing** mode. And then select the `+` button near the field name headers in the column display on the top right.

You can pick from the one of the available data types or set your own mapping.

## Operations

### Adding Data

The data browser allows adding data as a single JSON object or multiple JSON objects (passed as an array). It is recommended to pass up to 100 objects at a time.

### Updating Existing Data

Existing data records can be updated easily. Select a record from the view and tap the **Update** button.

### Deleting Data

Data records can also be deleted easily. Select a record (or multiple) from the view and tap the **Delete** button.

## Importing Data

You can directly import JSON or CSV data files into appbase.io using the **[data import](https://importer.appbase.io)** functionality.

Here is a pic showing import of a JSON file when creating a new app.

The import view lets you set the data mappings via a GUI and index data. Currently, it supports up to 100,000 records at a time (or up to 100 MB of data).

Once your data is imported, you can view the data via the [browser view](https://dashboard.appbase.io/browser).

#### Setting a Unique Document ID

When importing a frequently changing dataset, we recommend setting a **Unique Id** field. This can be enabled by selecting the checkbox for "Does the data have unique id?" question followed by selecting an id column (a **Mark as Id column** label should appear in the active column).

Setting a Unique Id column ensures that your dataset doesn't create duplicate documents across re-imports.

**When is it a good idea to use this feature?**

-   Do you frequently update existing documents?
-   Are you importing data from another data source (e.g. MongoDB, Google Analytics) where you already have a unique Id column?
-   Do you plan to interact with the imported data via code?
-   Do you have more than 1,000 documents?

You don't need to use this feature if your documents are never the same or if you are dealing with a very small set of documents.

#### Expected Formats

**JSON**

-   Spaces and/or special characters used in field names are automatically replaced with acceptable characters in the import view,
-   The expected shape for the JSON file is an Array of document objects.

```json
[
  {
    "field": "value",
    "nested_field": {
      "field": "value"
    },
    "array_field": ["A", "B"]
  },
  {
    ...
  }
]
```

**CSV**

-   If you are importing a CSV file, we treat the first row as the column **headers** row.
-   Spaces and/or special characters used in field names are automatically replaced with acceptable characters in the import view.
-   To set a null value in a specific cell, either leave the cell as empty or explicitly use the `null` keyword.
-   Column names ending with `lat` and `lon` are automatically detected to be of Geopoint datatype.
-   Setting an `Array` field from a CSV file requires the cell data to be wrapped in `"[..]"` brackets, e.g. `"[key1, key2]"`. (Note: If you are editing in Excel, the wrapping quotes (") aren't required)
-   Setting a nested field from a CSV file requires using a dot notation, e.g. `nested_field.a` and `nested_field.b` column names will be imported as sibling fields `a` and `b` within the `nested_field` field.

## Doing more with data

While data browser is great to get started with appbase.io and for visualizing data, the recommended way to add data programmatically is via the [REST API](/rest-quickstart.html) or one of the [JavaScript](/javascript/quickstart.html) or [Golang](https://godoc.org/github.com/appbaseio/go-appbase) libraries.

The data browser is still a great place to import, visualize and debug the existing data records with its filters and continuous query functionalities.
