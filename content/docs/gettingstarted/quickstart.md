[Appbase.io](https://appbase.io) provides a supercharged [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) experience for creating the most demanding app search experiences with a no-code search relevance control plane, UI builder, out-of-the-box search analytics and low-code UI components.

## Overview

With appbase.io, you can:

-   [Import your data](/docs/data/import/) from various sources via dashboard or CLI or REST APIs,
-   [Test search relevancy visually](/docs/search/relevancy/),
-   Build production grade search UIs using:
    1.   [UI component libraries](https://docs.appbase.io/docs/reactivesearch/gettingstarted/) that are available for React, Vue, React Native, Flutter, and vanilla JavaScript,
    2.  [A declarative REST API](/api/rest/overview/) or
    3.  [NoCode search UI builder](/docs/reactivesearch/ui-builder/search/).

-   Get out of the box [actionable analytics](/docs/analytics/overview/) on top searches, no result searches, slow queries and more,
-   Get improved search performance and throughput with [application layer caching](/docs/speed/cache-management/),
-   Build access controled search experiences with built-in Basic Auth or JWT based authentication, read/write access keys with granular ACLs, field level security, IP based rate limits, time to live - [read more over here](/docs/security/credentials/).

## Out of the Box Features

appbase.io offers the following advantages over running your own Elasticsearch cluster.

**Image:** appbase.io feature stack overview

1. **Analytics** - Get rich insights and analytics for your search app.
2. **Security** - Read/write access credentials, IP sources and HTTP Referers based restriction, Role based access control.
3. **Zero Ops** - Automated provisioning, scaling, logging and daily backups so you can enjoy a peace of mind.
4. **An Active Ecosystem** - From UI toolkits to build [search interfaces](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactivesearch) and [map UIs](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactivemaps), to the [leading Elasticsearch data browser](https://opensource.appbase.io/dejavu/) to a [GUI for writing queries](https://opensource.appbase.io/mirage/) to [backend data connectors](https://medium.appbase.io/abc-import-import-your-mongodb-sql-json-csv-data-into-elasticsearch-a202cafafc0d) to import data from SQL, MongoDB, JSON, CSV sources into Elasticsearch, we are actively working on open-standards to improve accessibility of building apps with appbase.io and Elasticsearch.
5. **No Vendor Lock-in** - Hosted APIs often come with a huge lock-in cost. appbase.io is offered as [a hosted API](https://appbase.io) as well as a [cloud native software](https://github.com/appbaseio/arc), offering a consistent experience without becoming a walled garden.
