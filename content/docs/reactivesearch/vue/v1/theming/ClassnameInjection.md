ReactiveSearch components also allow `class` injections to overwrite the default styles for any component at a more granular level. This can be achieved with the `innerClass` prop.

## Usage

The `innerClass` prop accepts an object with keys as defined in the **Styles** section of each component. You can add the desired `class` value for each key and refer to them in your CSS.

## Examples

Here's an example of how to use `innerClass` with a [DataSearch](/docs/reactivesearch/vue/v1/search/DataSearch/) component:

```js
<data-search
    ...
    :innerClass="{
        title: 'text-title',
        input: 'text-input'
    }"
/>
```

Then refer to them in your stylesheet.

```css
.text-title {
	font-size: 2rem;
}

.text-input {
	border: none;
}
```

Use the `recent-search-icon` and `popular-search-icon` keys to provide custom styles to your recent & popular search icons.

## CSS Specificity

While writing styles using `innerClass`, it's important to keep [CSS specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) in mind in order to get the desired results.

In order for your classes to overwrite the default classes of ReactiveSearch components we recommend combining the `innerClass` classes with a container class. This will also give the correct results without depending on the order of loading of the stylesheets in production. For example:

```js
<data-search
    ...
    :innerClass="{
        title: 'text-title',
        input: 'text-input'
    }"
    class="text-field"
/>
```

Then refer to them in your stylesheet with the container class as:

```css
.text-field .text-title {
	font-size: 2rem;
}

.text-field .text-input {
	border: none;
}
```

> Note
>
> Here we're using the `className` prop in the component to act as the container class, however, depending on your needs, this can also be acheived by surrounding the ReactiveSearch component in a container `<div class="container-class">...</div>`
