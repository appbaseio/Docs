We have built this library keeping you, the developer, in mind. If you're here, it is obvious that you want to create a custom component that is reactive in nature. Perhaps, you already have a component in your design kit and want it to work seamlessly with Reactivesearch.

With `ReactiveComponent`, you can convert any Vue Component into a Reactivesearch component i.e. your vue component will be able to talk to other Reactivesearch components and connect with your elasticsearch cluster seamlessly.

> How does this work?
>
> `ReactiveComponent` is a wrapper component that allows you to connect custom component(s) (passed as children) with the Vue ecosystem.

### Usage with defaultQuery

For example, let's suppose that we are building an e-commerce store where we have a react component called `ColorPicker` which renders the `colors` passed to it as tiles, allowing us to filter the products by their colors.

![ColorPicker](https://i.imgur.com/wuKhCTT.png)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<color-picker
    :colors="['#000', '#666', '#fff']"
    @change="handleColorChange">
</color-picker>
```

Now, let's assume that we have all these hex-codes stored as `keywords` in an Elasticsearch index. To display each unique color tile, we can run a `terms` aggregations query. The `defaultQuery` prop of ReactiveComponent allows us to do this and pass the results to a child component.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<template>
	<reactive-component
        componentId="myColorPicker"
        :defaultQuery="defaultQuery"
    >
		<div slot-scope="{ aggregations, hits, setQuery }">
			<color-picker-wrapper
                :aggregations="aggregations"
                :hits="hits"
                :setQuery="setQuery"
            />
		</div>
	</reactive-component>
</template>
<script>
	export default {
		name: 'app',
		methods: {
			defaultQuery() {
				return {
					aggs: {
						color: {
							terms: {
								field: 'color',
							},
						},
					},
				};
			},
		},
	};
</script>
```

The above snippet runs the `defaultQuery` passed to the ReactiveComponent when the component gets mounted and consequently pass the query results to the `ColorPickerWraper` component (i.e. child component of ReactiveComponent) as the following props: `hits`, `aggregationData` and `aggregations`.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<template>
    <div v-if="colors">
        <color-picker
            colors="colors"
            @change="handleColorChange"
        />
    </div>
</template>
<script>
	export default {
		props: {
			aggregations: Object,
		},
        methods: {
            handleColorChange() {...}
        },
		computed: {
			colors: () => {
				let colors = [];
				if (
					// checking for when component gets the aggregation results
					this.$props.aggregations &&
					this.$props.aggregations.colors &&
					this.$props.aggregations.colors.buckets.length
				) {
					colors = this.$props.aggregations.map(color => color.key);
				}
				return colors;
			},
		},
	};
</script>
```

Up until this point, we have figured out how to display the colored tiles by running an Elasticsearch query and passing the results to our `ColorPickerWrapper` component.

But we also need to be able to filter the products by a color tile when selected by the end-user. This is where `setQuery()` prop comes in handy. It takes an object param of shape:

```javascript
    {
        query: {}, // query of the component
		value: '',  // value of the component
		options: {}, // query options for e.g size, timeout & includeFields etc.
    }
```

where,

### query - is the query of the component,
### value - can be an array, string or number (This will be shown in selected filters and URLParams if active. In our case, this is the hex-code of the selected color tile)

In our current example, we would simply have to call `this.$props.setQuery()` with the updated query and value of the component:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<template>
	<div v-if="colors">
		<color-picker
            colors="colors"
            @change="onChange"
        />
	</div>
</template>
<script>
	export default {
		props: {
			aggregations: Object,
			setQuery: Function,
		},
		methods: {
			onChange(newColor) {
				// handles color change
				const query = {
					query: {
						term: { color: newColor },
					},
				};

				this.$props.setQuery({
					query,
					value: newColor,
				});
			},
		},
		computed: {
			colors: () => {
				let colors = [];
				if (
					// checking for when component gets the aggregation results
					this.$props.aggregations &&
					this.$props.aggregations.colors &&
					this.$props.aggregations.colors.buckets.length
				) {
					colors = this.$props.aggregations.map(color => color.key);
				}
				return colors;
			},
		},
	};
</script>
```

###Usage with customQuery
Let's suppose - we are building an e-commerce store for cars which displays a list of cars of a particular brand on their separate page as `example.com/cars/Ford`. Now, we want all the filters on that page (like pricing, type of car, model, year, etc) to only show the data relevant to the given brand (i.e. `Ford`). In this case, `ReactiveComponent` can be used with `customQuery` to achieve the desired behavior easily.

We can then use the given ReactiveComponent to be watched by all the filters (via `react` prop) to avail the desired brand based filtering for all the filters.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<template>
	<reactive-component
		componentId="CarSensor"
		:defaultQuery="defaultQuery"
		:customQuery="customQuery"
	>
		<div slot-scope="{ aggregations, setQuery }">
			<CustomComponent
                :aggregations="aggregations"
                :setQuery="setQuery"
            />
		</div>
	</reactive-component>
</template>
<script>
	export default {
		name: 'app',
		methods: {
			defaultQuery() {
				return {
					aggs: {
						'brand.keyword': {
							terms: {
								field: 'brand.keyword',
								order: {
									_count: 'desc',
								},
								size: 10,
							},
						},
					},
				};
			},
			customQuery() {
				return { query: { term: { ['brand.keyword']: 'Ford' } } };
			},
		},
	};
</script>
```

### Props

#### Scope Data Object

### loading `boolean`
    indicates that the query is still in progress
### error: `object`
    An object containing the error info
### data `Array`
    `data` prop is an array of parsed results(hits) from the Elasticsearch query of the component.
### rawData `object`
    An object of raw response as-is from elasticsearch query.
### promotedData: `array`
    An array of promoted results obtained from the applied query. [Read More](/docs/search/rules/)
### resultStats: `object`
    An object with the following properties which can be helpful to render custom stats:
    -   **`numberOfResults`**: `number`
        Total number of results found
    -   **`time`**: `number`
        Time taken to find total results (in ms)
    -   **`hidden`**: `number`
        Total number of hidden results found
    -   **`promoted`**: `number`
        Total number of promoted results found
### aggregations `Object`
    `aggregations` prop contains the results from `aggs` Elasticsearch query of the component.
### setQuery `function`
    `setQuery` function sets the query of the component. It takes an object param of shape:

```javascript
    {
        query: {}, // query of the component
		value: '',  // value of the component
		options: {}, // query options for e.g size, timeout & includeFields etc.
    }
```

### selectedValue `any`
    `selectedValue` contains the current value of the component (which can be set via `setQuery()` function). This is used for URLParams and SelectedFilters.
### isLoading `Boolean`
    `true` means the query is in the execution state.
### error `any`
    contains the error details in case of any error.

#### ReactiveComponent

### className `String`
    CSS class to be injected on the component container.
### aggregationField `String` [optional]
    One of the most important use-cases this enables is showing `DISTINCT` results (useful when you are dealing with sessions, events and logs type data). It utilizes `composite aggregations` which are newly introduced in ES v6 and offer vast performance benefits over a traditional terms aggregation.
    You can read more about it over [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-composite-aggregation.html). You can access `aggregationData` using `slot-scope` as shown:

    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    ```html
    <reactive-component
        componentId="myColorPicker"
        aggregationField="color"
    >
    	<div slot-scope="{ aggregationData, ...rest }">
    		<color-picker-wrapper
    			:aggregationData="aggregationData"
    			:hits="hits"
    			:setQuery="setQuery"
    		/>
    	</div>
    </reactive-component>
    ```

    > If you are using an app with elastic search version less than 6, then defining this prop will result in error and you need to catch this error using **error** event.

    > It is possible to override this query by providing `defaultQuery`.

    > Note: This prop has been marked as deprecated starting v1.14.0. Please use the `distinctField` prop instead.

### aggregationSize
    To set the number of buckets to be returned by aggregations.

    > Note: This is a new feature and only available for appbase versions >= 7.41.0.

### defaultQuery `Function`
    **returns** the default query to be applied to the component, as defined in Elasticsearch Query DSL.
### react `Object`
    `react` prop is available in components whose data view should reactively update when on or more dependent components change their states, e.g. [`ReactiveList`](/docs/reactivesearch/vue/result/ReactiveList/).

    -   **key** `String`
        one of `and`, `or`, `not` defines the combining clause.
        -   **and** clause implies that the results will be filtered by matches from **all** of the associated component states.
        -   **or** clause implies that the results will be filtered by matches from **at least one** of the associated component states.
        -   **not** clause implies that the results will be filtered by an **inverse** match of the associated component states.
    - **value** `String or Array or Object`
        -   `String` is used for specifying a single component by its `componentId`.
        -   `Array` is used for specifying multiple components by their `componentId`.
        -   `Object` is used for nesting other key clauses.

### URLParams `Boolean` [optional]
    enable creating a URL query string parameter based on the selected value of the list. This is useful for sharing URLs with the component state. Defaults to `false`.

### distinctField `String` [optional]
    This prop returns only the distinct value documents for the specified field. It is equivalent to the `DISTINCT` clause in SQL. It internally uses the collapse feature of Elasticsearch. You can read more about it over [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/collapse-search-results.html).

*   **distinctFieldConfig** `Object` [optional]
    This prop allows specifying additional options to the `distinctField` prop. Using the allowed DSL, one can specify how to return K distinct values (default value of K=1), sort them by a specific order, or return a second level of distinct values. `distinctFieldConfig` object corresponds to the `inner_hits` key's DSL. You can read more about it over [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/collapse-search-results.html).

```html
<reactive-component
	....
	distinctField="authors.keyword"
	:distinctFieldConfig="{
		inner_hits: {
			name: 'most_recent',
			size: 5,
			sort: [{ timestamp: 'asc' }],
		},
		max_concurrent_group_searches: 4,
	}"
/>
```

    > Note: In order to use the `distinctField` and `distinctFieldConfig` props, the `enableAppbase` prop must be set to true in `ReactiveBase`.

### index `String` [optional]
    The index prop can be used to explicitly specify an index to query against for this component. It is suitable for use-cases where you want to fetch results from more than one index in a single ReactiveSearch API request. The default value for the index is set to the `app` prop defined in the ReactiveBase component.

    > Note: This only works when `enableAppbase` prop is set to true in `ReactiveBase`.

### endpoint `Object` [optional] 
    endpoint prop provides the ability to query a user-defined backend service for this component, overriding the data endpoint configured in the ReactiveBase component. Works only when `enableAppbase` is `true`.
    Accepts the following properties:
    -   **url** `String` [Required]
        URL where the data cluster is hosted.
    -   **headers** `Object` [optional]        
        set custom headers to be sent with each server request as key/value pairs.
    -   **method** `String` [optional]    
        set method of the API request.
    -   **body** `Object` [optional]    
        request body of the API request. When body isn't set and method is POST, the request body is set based on the component's configured props.

    > - Overrides the endpoint property defined in ReactiveBase.
    > - If required, use `transformResponse` prop to transform response in component-consumable format.

## Events

### query-change
    is an event which accepts component's **prevQuery** and **nextQuery** as parameters. It is called everytime the component's query changes. This prop is handy in cases where you want to generate a side-effect whenever the component's query would change.
### data `Function`
    is an event which provides `data`, `rawData`, `promotedData`, `aggregationData`, `resultStats` and `aggregations` as function params.
### error
    gets triggered in case of an error and provides the `error` object, which can be used for debugging or giving feedback to the user if needed.
