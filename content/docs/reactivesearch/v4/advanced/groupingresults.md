-   [**CategorySearch**](/docs/reactivesearch/v4/search/categorysearch/#props)
-   [**ReactiveList**](/docs/reactivesearch/v4/result/reactivelist/#props)
-   [**ReactiveComponent**](/docs/reactivesearch/v4/advanced/reactivecomponent/#props)

## Why?

Grouping records usually refers to the process of combining multiple records into a single result, or consolidating many similar records into two or three results. This kind of de-duplication or aggregation of results has three primary use cases:

-   **Item Variations**: where any item with variations is displayed only once. A t-shirt that comes in five colors should only appear once in the results, with all five color options displayed somewhere in the description.
-   **Large Records**: where you first break up large record into smaller sub-records, and then during the search, if several of these sub-records match, you display the most relevant one.
-   **Grouping by attribute**: where you group records depending on the value of one of their attributes.

## How?

Let's take example of [carstore-dataset](https://dejavu.appbase.io/?appname=carstore-dataset-latest&url=https://B86d2y2OE:4fecb2c5-5c5f-49e5-9e0b-0faba74597c6@scalr.api.appbase.io&mode=view). We have different brands of cars, but we only want to show distinct brands.
This can be achieved by defining `distinctField` prop in `ReactiveList` as `brand.keyword`.
