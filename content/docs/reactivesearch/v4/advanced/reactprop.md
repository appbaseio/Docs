One of the key ideas behind Reactive Search and Reactive Maps is the reactive design pattern, which allows defining how a component reacts to changes in the states of the sensors. This allows almost all ReactiveSearch components to watch each other and update their data reactively. For example, a [SingleList](/docs/reactivesearch/v4/list/singlelist/) component can update its data based on the search term in a [DataSearch](/docs/reactivesearch/v4/search/searchbox/) component.

### Usage

```javascript
<ReactiveMap
    ...
    react={{
      "and": "citySensor",
      "or": "searchSensor"
    }}
>
```

### Props

### react `Object`
  `react` prop is available in components whose data view should reactively update when on or more dependent components change their states, e.g. [`ReactiveMap`](/docs/reactivesearch/v4/map/reactivegooglemap/), [`ReactiveList`](/docs/reactivesearch/v4/result/reactivelist/).
  -   **key** `String`
      one of `and`, `or`, `not` defines the combining clause.
      -   **and** clause implies that the results will be filtered by matches from **all** of the associated component states.
      -   **or** clause implies that the results will be filtered by matches from **at least one** of the associated component states.
      -   **not** clause implies that the results will be filtered by an **inverse** match of the associated component states.
  -   **value** `String or Array or Object`
      -   `String` is used for specifying a single component by its `componentId`.
      -   `Array` is used for specifying multiple components by their `componentId`.
      -   `Object` is used for nesting other key clauses.

An example of a `react` clause where all three clauses are used and values are `Object`, `Array` and `String`.

```js
<ReactiveMap
  ...
  react={{
    "and": {
        "or": ["CityComp", "TopicComp"],
        "not": "BlacklistComp"
    }
  }}
/>
```

Here, we are specifying that the map's UI should update whenever one of the blacklist items is not present and simultaneously any one of city or topics matches.
