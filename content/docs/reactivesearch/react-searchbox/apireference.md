`React SearchBox` offers a lightweight (~30KB: Minified + Gzipped) and performance focused searchbox UI component to query and display results from your ElasticSearch app (aka index) using declarative props. It is an alternative to using the [DataSearch component](/docs/reactivesearch/v3/search/datasearch) from ReactiveSearch.

### When to Use React SearchBox

We recommend using React Searchbox over DataSearch or CategorySearch when you only need to integrate a searchbox UI component into your app. If you are planning to user other UI filters or result components, it is ideal to use the [ReactiveSearch library](/docs/reactivesearch/v3/overview/quickstart/) instead of this standalone component.

Example uses of searchbox UI:

-   Searching a rental listing by its `name` or `description` fields.
-   Searching across e-commerce products.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```js
<SearchBox
	app="good-books-ds"
	credentials="nY6NNTZZ6:27b76b9f-18ea-456c-bc5e-3a5263ebc63d"
	dataField={['original_title', 'original_title.search']}
/>
```

### Usage With All Props

```js
<SearchBox
	app="good-books-ds"
	credentials="nY6NNTZZ6:27b76b9f-18ea-456c-bc5e-3a5263ebc63d"
	dataField={[
		{ field: 'original_title', weight: 1 },
		{ field: 'original_title.search', weight: 3 },
	]}
	title="Search"
	defaultValue="Songwriting"
	placeholder="Search for books"
	autosuggest={true}
	defaultSuggestions={[
		{ label: 'Songwriting', value: 'Songwriting' },
		{ label: 'Musicians', value: 'Musicians' },
	]}
	highlight={true}
	highlightField="group_city"
	queryFormat="or"
	fuzziness="AUTO"
	showClear
	showVoiceSearch
/>
```

## Props

-   **app** `string` [required]
    refers to an `index` if you‚Äôre using your own Elasticsearch cluster. If you're using an appbase.io hosted app, then the app name can be used.

    > Note: Multiple indexes can be connected to by specifying comma separated index names.

-   **url** `string` [required]
    URL for the Elasticsearch cluster. Defaults to `https://scalr.api.appbase.io`
-   **credentials** `string` [optional]
    Basic auth credentials for authentication purposes. It should be a string of the format `username:password`.
    If you are using an appbase.io app, you will find credentials under your [API credentials page](https://dashboard.appbase.io/app?view=credentials). If you are not using an appbase.io app, credentials may not be necessary - although having an open access to your Elasticsearch cluster is not recommended.
-   **dataField** `string | Array<string | DataField>` [required]
    database field(s) to be queried against. Accepts a String or an Array of either String or `DataField` type. The latter is useful for searching across multiple fields with field weights.<br/>
    Think of field weights as a way to apply weighted search. To use field weights, you can define the `dataField` prop as an array of objects of `DataField` type.<br/>
    The `DataField` type has the following shape:
    ```ts
    type DataField = {
    	field: string;
    	weight: number;
    };
    ```
-   **aggregationField** `string` [optional]
    One of the most important use-cases this enables is showing `DISTINCT` results (useful when you are dealing with sessions, events and logs type data).
    It utilizes `composite aggregations` which are newly introduced in ES v6 and offer vast performance benefits over a traditional terms aggregation.
    You can read more about it over [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-composite-aggregation.html).
    You can use `aggregationData` using `onAggregationData` callback.

    ```javascript
    <SearchBox
        app="good-book-ds-latest"
        credentials="IPM14ICqp:8e573e86-8802-4a27-a7a1-4c7d0c62c186"
        dataField="original_title"
        aggregationField="original_title.keyword"
        onAggregationData={(next, prev) => <>}
    />
    ```

    <!-- TODO: merge aggs branch of react and vue before merging this -->

    > See impact of aggregationField with these example for [React](/docs/reactivesearch/v3/advanced/groupingresults#how).

-   **analytics** `boolean` [optional]
    records search and click analytics when set to true and appbase.io is used as a backend. Defaults to false.
    Search analytics get recorded with no code changes required. For recording click analytic, you have to call the `triggerClickAnalytics` function (inside `render`) by using the `_click_id` property of the data item as an argument. Example:

    ```js
    <SearchBox
    	render={({ data, triggerClickAnalytics }) => {
    		return data.map(item => (
    			<div>
    				key={item._id}
    				onClick={() => triggerClickAnalytics(item._click_id)}
    			</div>
    		));
    	}}
    />
    ```

-   **analyticsConfig** `object` [optional]
    Set the `analyticsConfig` prop to customize the analytics experience when appbase.io is used as a backend. It accepts an object which has the following properties:

    -   **emptyQuery** `Boolean` If `false` then appbase.io will not record the analytics for the empty queries i.e `match_all` queries. Defaults to `true`.
    -   **suggestionAnalytics** `Boolean` If `false` then appbase.io will not record the click analytics for the suggestions. Defaults to `true`.
    -   **userId** `String` It allows you to define the user id which will be used to record the appbase.io analytics.
    -   **customEvents** `Object` It allows you to set the custom events which can be used to build your own analytics on top of the appbase.io analytics. Further, these events can be used to filter the analytics stats from the appbase.io dashboard.
        <br/>
        For example in the following code, we're setting up two custom events that will be recorded with each search request.

    ```js
    <SearchBox
    	analytics
    	analyticsConfig={{
    		customEvents: {
    			platform: 'ios',
    			device: 'iphoneX',
    		},
    	}}
    />
    ```

    > Note: **analyticsConfig** prop will only work when **analytics={true}**

-   **nestedField** `String` [optional]
    Set the path of the `nested` type under which the `dataField` is present. Only applicable only when the field(s) specified in the `dataField` is(are) present under a [`nested` type](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/nested.html) mapping.
-   **title** `String or JSX` [optional]
    set the title of the component to be shown in the UI.
-   **defaultValue** `string` [optional]
    set the initial search query text on mount.
-   **value** `string` [optional]
    sets the current value of the component. It sets the search query text (on mount and on update). Use this prop in conjunction with the `onChange` prop.
-   **downShiftProps** `Object` [optional]
    allow passing props directly to the underlying `Downshift` component. You can read more about Downshift props [here](https://github.com/paypal/downshift#--downshift-------).
-   **placeholder** `String` [optional]
    set placeholder text to be shown in the component's input field. Defaults to "Search".
-   **showIcon** `Boolean` [optional]
    whether to display a search or custom icon in the input box. Defaults to `true`.
-   **iconPosition** `String` [optional]
    sets the position of the search icon. Can be set to either `left` or `right`. Defaults to `right`.
-   **icon** `JSX` [optional]
    set a custom search icon instead of the default icon üîç
-   **showClear** `Boolean` [optional]
    show a clear text `X` icon. Defaults to `false`.
-   **clearIcon** `JSX` [optional]
    set a custom icon for clearing text instead of the default cross.
-   **autosuggest** `Boolean` [optional]
    set whether the autosuggest functionality should be enabled or disabled. Defaults to `true`.
-   **strictSelection** `Boolean` [optional]
    defaults to `false`. When set to `true`, the component will only set its value and fire the query if the value was selected from the suggestion. Otherwise, the value will be cleared on selection. This is only relevant with `autosuggest`.
-   **defaultSuggestions** `Array` [optional]
    preset search suggestions to be shown on focus when the SearchBox does not have any search query text set. Accepts an array of objects each having a **label** and **value** property. The label can contain either String or an HTML element.
-   **debounce** `Number` [optional]
    set the milliseconds to wait before executing the query. Defaults to `0`, i.e. no debounce.
-   **highlight** `Boolean` [optional]
    whether highlighting should be enabled in the returned results.
-   **highlightField** `String or Array` [optional]
    when highlighting is enabled, this prop allows specifying the fields which should be returned with the matching highlights. When not specified, it defaults to applying highlights on the field(s) specified in the **dataField** prop.
-   **queryFormat** `String` [optional]
    Sets the query format, can be **or** or **and**. Defaults to **or**.
    -   **or** returns all the results matching **any** of the search query text's parameters. For example, searching for "bat man" with **or** will return all the results matching either "bat" or "man".
    -   On the other hand with **and**, only results matching both "bat" and "man" will be returned. It returns the results matching **all** of the search query text's parameters.
-   **fuzziness** `String or Number` [optional]
    Sets a maximum edit distance on the search parameters, can be **0**, **1**, **2** or **"AUTO"**. Useful for showing the correct results for an incorrect search parameter by taking the fuzziness into account. For example, with a substitution of one character, **fox** can become **box**. Read more about it in the elastic search [docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzziness.html).
-   **showVoiceSearch** `Boolean` [optional]
    show a voice icon in the searchbox to enable users to set voice input. Defaults to `false`.
-   **searchOperators** `Boolean` [optional]
    Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, ou can use special characters in the search query to enable an advanced search behavior.<br/>
    Read more about it [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-simple-query-string-query.html).
-   **URLParams** `Boolean` [optional]
    enable creating a URL query string param based on the search query text value. This is useful for sharing URLs with the component state. Defaults to `false`.
-   **render** `Function` [optional]
    You can render suggestions in a custom layout by using the `render` prop.
    <br/>
    It accepts an object with these properties:
    -   **`loading`**: `boolean`
        indicates that the query is still in progress.
    -   **`error`**: `object`
        An object containing the error info.
    -   **`data`**: `array`
        An array of parsed suggestions obtained from the applied query.
    -   **`rawData`**: `array`
        An array of original suggestions obtained from the applied query.
    -   **`value`**: `string`
        current search input value i.e the search query being used to obtain suggestions.
    -   **`downshiftProps`**: `object`
        provides all the control props from `downshift` which can be used to bind list items with click/mouse events.
        Read more about it [here](https://github.com/downshift-js/downshift#children-function).

```js
<SearchBox
	render={({ loading, error, data, value, downshiftProps: { isOpen, getItemProps } }) => {
		if (loading) {
			return <div>Fetching Suggestions.</div>;
		}
		if (error) {
			return <div>Something went wrong! Error details {JSON.stringify(error)}</div>;
		}
		return isOpen && Boolean(value.length) ? (
			<div>
				{data.slice(0, 5).map((suggestion, index) => (
					<div key={suggestion.value} {...getItemProps({ item: suggestion })}>
						{suggestion.value}
					</div>
				))}
				{Boolean(value.length) && (
					<div {...getItemProps({ item: { label: value, value: value } })}>
						Show all results for "{value}"
					</div>
				)}
			</div>
		) : null;
	}}
/>
```

Or you can also use render function as children

```js
<SearchBox>
        {
            ({
                loading,
                error,
                data,
                rawData,
                value,
                downshiftProps
            }) => (
                // return UI to be rendered
            )
        }
</SearchBox>
```

-   **renderError** `String or JSX or Function` [optional]
    can be used to render an error message in case of any error.
    ```js
    renderError={(error) => (
            <div>
                Something went wrong!<br/>Error details<br/>{error}
            </div>
        )
    }
    ```
-   **renderNoSuggestion** `String or JSX or Function` [optional]
    can be used to render a message when there are no suggestions found.
    ```js
    renderNoSuggestion={() => (
            <div>
                No suggestions found
            </div>
        )
    }
    ```
-   **getMicInstance** `Function` [optional]
    You can pass a callback function to get the instance of `SpeechRecognition` object, which can be used to override the default configurations.
-   **renderMic** `String or JSX or Function` [optional]
    can be used to render the custom mic option.<br/>
    It accepts an object with the following properties:

    -   **`handleClick`**: `function`
        needs to be called when the mic option is clicked.
    -   **`status`**: `string`
        is a constant which can have one of these values:<br/>
        `INACTIVE` - mic is in inactive state i.e not listening<br/>
        `STOPPED` - mic has been stopped by the user<br/>
        `ACTIVE` - mic is listening<br/>
        `DENIED` - permission is not allowed<br/>

    ```js
    	renderMic = {({ onClick, status }) => {
    				switch(status) {
    					case 'ACTIVE':
    						return <img src="/active_mic.png" onClick={onClick} />
    					case 'DENIED':
    					case 'STOPPED':
    						return <img src="/mute_mic.png" onClick={onClick} />
    					default:
    						return <img src="/inactive_mic.png" onClick={onClick} />
    				}
    	}}
    ```

-   **onChange** `function` [optional]
    is a callback function which accepts component's current **value** as a parameter. It is called when you are using the `value` prop and the component's value changes. This prop is used to implement the [controlled component](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) behavior.

    ```js
    <SearchBox
    	value={this.state.value}
    	onChange={(value, triggerQuery, event) => {
    		this.setState(
    			{
    				value,
    			},
    			() => triggerQuery(),
    		);
    	}}
    />
    ```

> Note:
>
> If you're using the controlled behavior then it's your responsibility to call the `triggerQuery` method to update the query i.e execute the search query and update the query results in connected components by `react` prop. It is not mandatory to call the `triggerQuery` in `onChange` you can also call it in other input handlers like `onBlur` or `onKeyPress`.

-   **onSuggestions** `Function` [optional]
    You can pass a callback function to listen for the changes in suggestions. The function receives `suggestions` list.
-   **onError** `Function` [optional]
    You can pass a callback function that gets triggered in case of an error and provides the `error` object which can be used for debugging or giving feedback to the user if needed.

## Demo

## Styles

`SearchBox` component supports an `innerClass` prop to provide styles to the sub-components of SearchBox. These are the supported keys:

-   `title`
-   `input`
-   `list`

Read more about it [here](/docs/reactivesearch/v3/theming/classnameinjection/).

## Extending

`SearchBox` component can be extended to:

1. customize the look and feel with `className`, `style`,
2. connect with external interfaces using `beforeValueChange`, `onValueChange` and `onQueryChange`,
3. add the following [synthetic events](https://reactjs.org/events.html) to the underlying `input` element:

    - onBlur
    - onFocus
    - onKeyPress
    - onKeyDown
    - onKeyUp
    - autoFocus

    > Note:
    >
    > 1. All these events accepts the `triggerQuery` as a second parameter which can be used to trigger the `SearchBox` query with the current selected value (useful to customize the search query execution).
    > 2. There is a known [issue](https://github.com/appbaseio/reactivesearch/issues/1087) with `onKeyPress` when `autosuggest` is set to true. It is recommended to use `onKeyDown` for the consistency.

```js
<SearchBox
  ...
  className="custom-class"
  style={{"paddingBottom": "10px"}}
  beforeValueChange={
    function(value) {
      // called before the value is set
      // returns a promise
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // update state or component props
        resolve()
        // or reject()
      })
    }
  }
  onValueChange={
    function(value) {
      console.log("current value: ", value)
      // set the state
      // use the value with other js code
    }
  }
  onQueryChange={
    function(prevQuery, nextQuery) {
      // use the query with other js code
      console.log('prevQuery', prevQuery);
      console.log('nextQuery', nextQuery);
    }
  }

/>
```

-   **className** `String`
    CSS class to be injected on the component container.
-   **style** `Object`
    CSS styles to be applied to the **SearchBox** component.
-   **defaultQuery** `Function`
    is a callback function that takes **value** and **props** as parameters and **returns** the data query to be applied to the source component as defined in Elasticsearch Query DSL.<br/>
    Read more about it [here](/docs/reactivesearch/v3/advanced/customquery#when-to-use-default-query).
-   **beforeValueChange** `Function`
    is a callback function which accepts component's future **value** as a parameter and **returns** a promise. It is called every-time before a component's value changes. The promise, if and when resolved, triggers the execution of the component's query and if rejected, kills the query execution. This method can act as a gatekeeper for query execution, since it only executes the query after the provided promise has been resolved.
-   **onValueChange** `Function`
    is a callback function which accepts component's current **value** as a parameter. It is called every-time the component's value changes. This prop is handy in cases where you want to generate a side-effect on value selection. For example: You want to show a pop-up modal with the valid discount coupon code when a user searches for a product in a SearchBox.
-   **onQueryChange** `Function`
    is a callback function which accepts component's **prevQuery** and **nextQuery** as parameters. It is called everytime the component's query changes. This prop is handy in cases where you want to generate a side-effect whenever the component's query would change.
