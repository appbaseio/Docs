`ToggleButton` creates a toggle button UI component that is connected to a database field. It is used for filtering results based on a fixed set of toggle-able options.

Example uses:

-   filter movies by ratings between 1 and 5,
-   display restaurants that accept delivery and are open now,
-   show flight tickets by one way, round trip and multi-city options.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```js
<ToggleButton
	componentId="MeetupTops"
	dataField="group_topics.topic_name.raw"
	data={[
		{ label: 'Social', value: 'Social' },
		{ label: 'Travel', value: 'Travel' },
		{ label: 'Outdoors', value: 'Outdoors' },
	]}
/>
```

### Usage With All Props

```js
<ToggleButton
	componentId="MeetupTops"
	dataField="group_topics.topic_name.raw"
	data={[
		{ label: 'Social', value: 'Social' },
		{ label: 'Travel', value: 'Travel' },
		{ label: 'Outdoors', value: 'Outdoors' },
	]}
	title="Meetups"
	defaultValue={['Social']}
	multiSelect={true}
	showFilter={true}
	filterLabel="City"
	URLParams={false}
/>
```

## Props

-   **componentId** `String`
    unique identifier of the component, can be referenced in other components' `react` prop.
-   **dataField** `String`
    data field to be connected to the component's UI view.
-   **data** `Object Array`
    collection of UI `labels` with associated `value` to be matched against the database field.
-   **nestedField** `String` [optional]
    use to set the `nested` mapping field that allows arrays of objects to be indexed in a way that they can be queried independently of each other. Applicable only when dataField is a part of `nested` type.
-   **title** `String` or `JSX` [optional]
    title of the component to be shown in the UI.
-   **defaultValue** `String` or `Array` [optional]
    an array of default selected label(s) to pre-select one or more buttons.
-   **value** `String Array` [optional]
    controls the current value of the component. It selects the label (on mount and on update). Use this prop in conjunction with `onChange` function.
-   **multiSelect** `Boolean` [optional]
    whether multiple buttons can be selected, defaults to **true**. When set to **false**, only one button can be selected.
-   **showFilter** `Boolean` [optional]
    show as filter when a value is selected in a global selected filters view. Defaults to `true`.
-   **filterLabel** `String` [optional]
    An optional label to display for the component in the global selected filters view. This is only applicable if `showFilter` is enabled. Default value used here is `componentId`.
-   **URLParams** `Boolean` [optional]
    enable creating a URL query string parameter based on the selected value of the list. This is useful for sharing URLs with the component state. Defaults to `false`.
-   **onChange** `function` [optional]
    is a callback function which accepts component's current **value** as a parameter. It is called when you are using the `value` props and the component's value changes. This prop is used to implement the [controlled component](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms/#controlled-components) behavior.
-   **enableStrictSelection** `Boolean` [optional]
    When set to `true`, a selected option can't be unselected. Although, it is possible to change the selected option. Defaults to `false`.
    
	> Note: This only works when `multiSelect` prop is set to `false`.

## Styles

`ToggleButton` component supports `innerClass` prop with the following keys:

-   `title`
-   `button`

Read more about it [here](/docs/reactivesearch/v3/theming/classnameinjection/).

## Extending

`ToggleButton` component can be extended to

1. customize the look and feel with `className`, `style`,
2. update the underlying DB query with `customQuery`,
3. connect with external interfaces using `beforeValueChange`, `onValueChange` and `onQueryChange`.

```js
<ToggleButton
  ...
  className="custom-class"
  style={{"paddingBottom": "10px"}}
  customQuery={
    function(value, props) {
      return {
        query: {
          match: {
            data_field: "this is a test"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  beforeValueChange={
    function(value) {
      // called before the value is set
      // returns a promise
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // update state or component props
        resolve()
        // or reject()
      })
    }
  }
  onValueChange={
    function(value) {
      console.log("current value: ", value)
      // set the state
      // use the value with other js code
    }
  }
  onQueryChange={
    function(prevQuery, nextQuery) {
      // use the query with other js code
      console.log('prevQuery', prevQuery);
      console.log('nextQuery', nextQuery);
    }
  }
/>
```

-   **className** `String`
    CSS class to be injected on the component container.
-   **style** `Object`
    CSS styles to be applied to the **ToggleButton** component.
-   **customQuery** `Function`
    takes **value** and **props** as parameters and **returns** the data query to be applied to the component, as defined in Elasticsearch Query DSL.
    `Note:` customQuery is called on value changes in the **ToggleButton** component as long as the component is a part of `react` dependency of at least one other component.
-   **beforeValueChange** `Function`
    is a callback function which accepts component's future **value** as a parameter and **returns** a promise. It is called everytime before a component's value changes. The promise, if and when resolved, triggers the execution of the component's query and if rejected, kills the query execution. This method can act as a gatekeeper for query execution, since it only executes the query after the provided promise has been resolved.

    > Note:
    >
    > If you're using Reactivesearch version >= `3.3.7`, `beforeValueChange` can also be defined as a synchronous function. `value` is updated by default, unless you throw an `Error` to reject the update. For example:

    ```js
    beforeValueChange = values => {
        // The update is accepted by default
    	if (values.includes('Social')) {
    		// To reject the update, throw an error
    		throw Error('Selected value should not include Social.');
    	}
    };
    ```

-   **onValueChange** `Function`
    is a callback function which accepts component's current **value** as a parameter. It is called everytime the component's value changes. This prop is handy in cases where you want to generate a side-effect on value selection. For example: You want to show a pop-up modal with the valid discount coupon code(s) when button(s) is/are selected in a "Discounted Price" ToggleButton.
-   **onQueryChange** `Function`
    is a callback function which accepts component's **prevQuery** and **nextQuery** as parameters. It is called everytime the component's query changes. This prop is handy in cases where you want to generate a side-effect whenever the component's query would change.
-   **index** `String` [optional]
    The index prop can be used to explicitly specify an index to query against for this component. It is suitable for use-cases where you want to fetch results from more than one index in a single ReactiveSearch API request. The default value for the index is set to the `app` prop defined in the ReactiveBase component.

    > Note: This only works when `enableAppbase` prop is set to true in `ReactiveBase`.
