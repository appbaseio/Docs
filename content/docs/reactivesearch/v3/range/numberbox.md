`NumberBox` creates a box (or button) based numeric UI component. It is used for filtering results based on a numeric query.

Example uses:

-   filtering hotel listings based on the number of guests,
-   filtering movies or products by ratings.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```js
<NumberBox
	componentId="NumberBoxSensor"
	dataField="guests"
	data={{ label: 'Guests', start: 0, end: 5 }}
	title="NumberBox component"
/>
```

### Usage With All Props

```js
<NumberBox
    componentId="NumberBoxSensor"
    dataField="guests"
    data={{ label: 'Guests', start: 0, end: 5 }}
    title="NumberBox component"
    defaultValue={0}
    labelPosition="left"
    queryFormat="gte"
    endpoint={{
      url:"https://appbase-demo-ansible-abxiydt-arc.searchbase.io/recipes-demo/_reactivesearch.v3", //mandatory
      headers:{
        // relevant headers
      },
      method: 'PATCH',
      body: {
        // request body
      },
    }}
    URLParams={false}
/>
```

## Props

-   **componentId** `String`
    unique identifier of the component, can be referenced in other components' `react` prop.
-   **endpoint** `Object` [optional] 
    endpoint prop provides the ability to query a different backend service other than elasticesearch. Works only when `enableAppbase` is `true`.
    Accepts the following properties:
    -   **url** `String` [Required]
        URL where the data cluster is hosted.
    -   **headers** `Object` [optional]        
        set custom headers to be sent with each server request as key/value pairs.
    -   **method** `String` [optional]    
        set method of the API request.
    -   **body** `Object` [optional]    
        request body of the API request.

    > Overrides the endpoint property defined in ReactiveBase.

-   **dataField** `String`
    DB data field to be mapped with the component's UI view. The selected box value creates a database query on this field.
-   **data** `Object`
    an object with `start` and `end` values and optionally an associated `label` to be displayed in the UI.
-   **nestedField** `String` [optional]
    use to set the `nested` mapping field that allows arrays of objects to be indexed in a way that they can be queried independently of each other. Applicable only when dataField is a part of `nested` type.
-   **title** `String or JSX` [optional]
    title of the component to be shown in the UI.
-   **defaultValue** `Number` [optional]
    sets a initial valid value within the [start, end] range on mount.
-   **value** `Number` [optional]
    controls the current value of the component (on mount and on update).Use this prop in conjunction with `onChange` function.
-   **onChange** `function` [optional]
    is a callback function which accepts component's current **value** as a parameter. It is called when you are using the `value` prop and the component's value changes. This prop is used to implement the [controlled component](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html/#controlled-components) behavior.
-   **labelPosition** `String` [optional]
    position where label is shown, one of "left", "top", "right", "bottom". Defaults to `left`.
-   **queryFormat** `String` [optional]
    type of query to perform, one of `exact`, `gte` and `lte`:

    -   `exact` implies a query match with the exact value as the one selected in the UI view,
    -   `gte` implies a query match that satisfies all values that are greater than or equal to the one selected in the UI view.
    -   `lte` implies a query match that satisfies all values that are less than or equal to the one selected in the UI view.

    Defaults to `gte`.

-   **URLParams** `Boolean` [optional]
    enable creating a URL query string parameter based on the selected value of the number. This is useful for sharing URLs with the component state. Defaults to `false`.

## Styles

`NumberBox` component supports `innerClass` prop with the following keys:

-   `title`
-   `label`
-   `button`

Read more about it [here](/docs/reactivesearch/v3/theming/classnameinjection/).

## Extending

`NumberBox` component can be extended to

1. customize the look and feel with `className`, `style`,
2. update the underlying DB query with `customQuery`,
3. connect with external interfaces using `beforeValueChange`, `onValueChange` and `onQueryChange`.

```js
<NumberBox
  ...
  className="custom-class"
  style={{"paddingBottom": "10px"}}
  customQuery={
    function(value, props) {
      return {
        query: {
            match: {
                data_field: "this is a test"
            }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  beforeValueChange={
    function(value) {
      // called before the value is set
      // returns a promise
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // update state or component props
        resolve()
        // or reject()
      })
    }
  }
  onValueChange={
    function(value) {
      console.log("current value: ", value)
      // set the state
      // use the value with other js code
    }
  }
  onQueryChange={
    function(prevQuery, nextQuery) {
      // use the query with other js code
      console.log('prevQuery', prevQuery);
      console.log('nextQuery', nextQuery);
    }
  }
/>
```

-   **className** `String`
    CSS class to be injected on the component container.
-   **style** `Object`
    CSS styles to be applied to the **NumberBox** component.
-   **customQuery** `Function`
    takes **value** and **props** as parameters and **returns** the data query to be applied to the component, as defined in Elasticsearch Query DSL.
    `Note:` customQuery is called on value changes in the **NumberBox** component as long as the component is a part of `react` dependency of at least one other component.
-   **beforeValueChange** `Function`
    is a callback function which accepts component's future **value** as a parameter and **returns** a promise. It is called everytime before a component's value changes. The promise, if and when resolved, triggers the execution of the component's query and if rejected, kills the query execution. This method can act as a gatekeeper for query execution, since it only executes the query after the provided promise has been resolved.

    > Note:
    >
    > If you're using Reactivesearch version >= `3.3.7`, `beforeValueChange` can also be defined as a synchronous function. `value` is updated by default, unless you throw an `Error` to reject the update. For example:

    ```js
    beforeValueChange = value => {
        // The update is accepted by default
    	if (value > 10) {
    		// To reject the update, throw an error
    		throw Error('No of persons must be less than or equal to 10.');
    	}
    };
    ```

-   **onValueChange** `Function`
    is a callback function which accepts component's current **value** as a parameter. It is called everytime the component's value changes. This prop is handy in cases where you want to generate a side-effect on value selection. For example: You want to show a pop-up modal with the valid discount coupon code when a number is selected in a NumberBox.
-   **onQueryChange** `Function`
    is a callback function which accepts component's **prevQuery** and **nextQuery** as parameters. It is called everytime the component's query changes. This prop is handy in cases where you want to generate a side-effect whenever the component's query would change.
-   **index** `String` [optional]
    The index prop can be used to explicitly specify an index to query against for this component. It is suitable for use-cases where you want to fetch results from more than one index in a single ReactiveSearch API request. The default value for the index is set to the `app` prop defined in the ReactiveBase component.

    > Note: This only works when `enableAppbase` prop is set to true in `ReactiveBase`.
