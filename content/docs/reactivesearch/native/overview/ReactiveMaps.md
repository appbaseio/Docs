ReactiveMaps is a complimentary library to ReactiveSearch. Map component requires ReactiveSearch architecture and its root component to begin with. If you wish to build anything with reactivemaps-native, youâ€™ll need to install reactivesearch-native along with it.

## Get started with ReactiveMap with react-native:

In this tutorial, we will be using `expo-cli` to setup the project. If you wish to use `Reactivemap` with any existing project with no dependency on `Expo`, we'd recommend you to install it and set up the project with Expo, as we only support Reactivemap with `Expo` as of now.

### Step 0: Create Boilerplate with expo-cli

For this quickstart guide, we will use [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v32.0.0/introduction/installation/) and [Expo client](https://expo.io/tools#client).

Install `expo-cli` globally.

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Create sample application using `expo-cli`

```bash
expo init EarthQuakeReporter
cd EarthQuakeReporter
```

### Step 1: Install the reactive search and maps package:

```bash
yarn add @appbaseio/reactivesearch-native @appbaseio/reactivemaps-native
```

### Step 2: Configure Google Map:

Now before we go ahead and add our first component, we need to add the map keys to our setup. Using react-native-maps with Expo makes the setup and installation trivial, we simply need to specify the google-maps key in the expo configuration:

Your `app.json` should look like this:

```js
{
  "expo": {
    "sdkVersion": "32.0.0",
    "android": {
      "config": {
        "googleMaps": {
          "apiKey": "<ADD_YOUR_KEY_HERE>"
        }
      }
    },
    "ios": {
      "config": {
        "googleMapsApiKey": "<ADD_YOUR_KEY_HERE>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And now, you're all set. You can read more about it in detail [here](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/map-view).

### Step 3: Adding the first component

Lets add our first ReactiveSearch component: [ReactiveBase](/docs/reactivesearch/native/overview/reactivebase/), it is a backend connector where we can configure the Elasticsearch index / authorization setup.

We will demonstrate creating an index using [appbase.io](https://appbase.io) service, although you can use any Elasticsearch backend within ReactiveBase.

**Caption:** For the example that we will build, the app is called **earthquake** and the associated read-only credentials are **OrXIHcgHn:d539c6e7-ed14-4407-8214-c227b0600d8e**. You can browse and clone the dataset into your own app from [here](https://opensource.appbase.io/dejavu/live/#?input_state=XQAAAALbAAAAAAAAAAA9iIqnY-B2BnTZGEQz6wkFsksm3uHy0SJtl-GeS5hzLniAOGDpQVx6D3EoHDw86D_nWcj3PFS3n-DeQd1AOGTWMc5BFSwDVWM1rIpc6OlpeC62Gy4w2bVXsGB02GpXZQAh7epRyt_JV9IiqJyJgzW4vnZefow_cv_nao-NILgskqGbL7TKfAlU6TNHrnj6tr0m0GfAmwInsE1EsphIl_PBW7bxGvDzAfZF13Ec1QA8dB_-a82A&editable=false).

![Dataset](https://i.imgur.com/vKmqxdP.png)

We will update our `src/App.js` file to add ReactiveBase component.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

import { ReactiveBase } from '@appbaseio/reactivesearch-native';

export default class App extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
				<ReactiveBase
					app="earthquake"
					credentials="OrXIHcgHn:d539c6e7-ed14-4407-8214-c227b0600d8e"
					type="places"
				/>
			</View>
		);
	}
}
```

### Step 4: Adding the Map Component

Next we will look at Reactivemap component:

```js
<ReactiveMap
	componentId="map"
	dataField="location"
	onPopoverClick={item => <Text>Run before it exceeds {item.mag}</Text>}
/>
```

For its prop usage, check out Reactivemaps [docs](/docs/reactivesearch/native/components/reactivemap/).

Finally, your app should look like this:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

import { ReactiveBase } from '@appbaseio/reactivesearch-native';
import ReactiveMap from '@appbaseio/reactivemaps-native';

export default class App extends React.Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
				<ReactiveBase
					app="earthquake"
					credentials="OrXIHcgHn:d539c6e7-ed14-4407-8214-c227b0600d8e"
					type="places"
				>
					<View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
						<ReactiveMap
							componentId="map"
							dataField="location"
							onPopoverClick={item => <Text>Run before it exceeds {item.mag}</Text>}
						/>
					</View>
				</ReactiveBase>
			</View>
		);
	}
}
```

If you have followed along so far, you should be able to see the final app:
