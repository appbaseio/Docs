## How does it work?

SearchBox offers a lightweight and performance focused searchbox UI component to query and display results from your Elasticsearch cluster.

## Props

### Configure appbase.io environment

The below props are only needed if you're not using the `SearchBox` component under [SearchBase](docs/reactivesearch/searchbase/overview/searchbase/) provider. These props can also be used to override the global environment defined in the [SearchBase](docs/reactivesearch/searchbase/overview/searchbase/) component.

-   **index** `string` [required]
    Refers to an index of the Elasticsearch cluster.

    `Note:` Multiple indexes can be connected to by specifying comma-separated index names.

-   **url** `string` [required]
    URL for the Elasticsearch cluster

-   **credentials** `string` [required]
    Basic Auth credentials if required for authentication purposes. It should be a string of the format `username:password`. If you are using an appbase.io cluster, you will find credentials under the `Security > API credentials` section of the appbase.io dashboard. If you are not using an appbase.io cluster, credentials may not be necessary - although having open access to your Elasticsearch cluster is not recommended.

-   **appbaseConfig** `Object`
    allows you to customize the analytics experience when appbase.io is used as a backend. It accepts an object which has the following properties:

    -   **recordAnalytics** `boolean` allows recording search analytics (and click analytics) when set to `true` and appbase.io is used as a backend. Defaults to `false`.
    -   **enableQueryRules** `boolean` If `false`, then appbase.io will not apply the query rules on the search requests. Defaults to `true`.
    -   **userId** `string` It allows you to define the user id to be used to record the appbase.io analytics. Defaults to the client's IP address.
    -   **customEvents** `Object` It allows you to set the custom events which can be used to build your own analytics on top of appbase.io analytics. Further, these events can be used to filter the analytics stats from the appbase.io dashboard.
    -   **enableTelemetry** `Boolean` When set to `false`, disable the telemetry. Defaults to `true`.

### To configure the ReactiveSearch API

The following properties can be used to configure the appbase.io [ReactiveSearch API](/docs/search/reactivesearch-api/):

-   **id** `string` [required]
    unique identifier of the component, can be referenced in other components' `react` prop.

-   **dataField** `string | Array<string | DataField>`
    index field(s) to be connected to the component’s UI view. SearchBox accepts an `Array` in addition to `string`, which is useful for searching across multiple fields with or without field weights.<br/>
    Field weights allow weighted search for the index fields. A higher number implies a higher relevance weight for the corresponding field in the search results.<br/>
    You can define the `dataField` property as an array of objects of the `DataField` type to set the field weights.<br/>
    The `DataField` type has the following shape:

    ```ts
    type DataField = {
    	field: string;
    	weight: number;
    };
    ```

-   **queryFormat** `string`
    Sets the query format, can be **or** or **and**. Defaults to **or**.

    -   **or** returns all the results matching **any** of the search query text's parameters. For example, searching for "bat man" with **or** will return all the results matching either "bat" or "man".
    -   On the other hand with **and**, only results matching both "bat" and "man" will be returned. It returns the results matching **all** of the search query text's parameters.

-   **react** `Object`
    `react` prop is useful for components whose data view should reactively update when on or more dependent components change their states, e.g. a component to display the results can depend on the search component to filter the results.
    -   **key** `string`
        one of `and`, `or`, `not` defines the combining clause.
        -   **and** clause implies that the results will be filtered by matches from **all** of the associated component states.
        -   **or** clause implies that the results will be filtered by matches from **at least one** of the associated component states.
        -   **not** clause implies that the results will be filtered by an **inverse** match of the associated component states.
    -   **value** `string or Array or Object`
        -   `string` is used for specifying a single component by its `id`.
        -   `Array` is used for specifying multiple components by their `id`.
        -   `Object` is used for nesting other key clauses.

An example of a `react` clause where all three clauses are used and values are `Object`, `Array` and `string`.

```html
<search-box
	id="search-component"
	:dataField="['original_title', 'original_title.search']"
	:react="{
		and: {
			or: ['CityComp', 'TopicComp'],
			not: 'BlacklistComp',
		},
	}"
/>
```

Here, we are specifying that the suggestions should update whenever one of the blacklist items is not present and simultaneously any one of the city or topics matches.

-   **size** `number`
    Number of suggestions and results to fetch per request.

-   **from** `number`
    To define from which page to start the results, it is important to implement pagination.

-   **includeFields** `Array<string>`
    fields to be included in search results.

-   **excludeFields** `Array<string>`
    fields to be excluded in search results.

-   **sortBy** `string`
    sort the results by either `asc` or `desc` order.

-   **aggregationField** `string` [optional]
    One of the most important use-cases this enables is showing `DISTINCT` results (useful when you are dealing with sessions, events, and logs type data).
    It utilizes `composite aggregations` which are newly introduced in ES v6 and offer vast performance benefits over a traditional terms aggregation.
    You can read more about it over [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-composite-aggregation.html).
    You can use `aggregationData` using `onAggregationData` callback or `subscriber`.
	> Note: This prop has been marked as deprecated starting v1.2.0. Please use the `distinctField` prop instead.

```html
<template>
	<search-box
		id="result-component"
		:dataField="['original_title', 'original_title.search']"
		aggregationField="original_title.keyword"
		@aggregationData="handleAggregationData"
	/>
</template>
<script>
	export default App {
	    name: 'App',
	    methods: {
	        handleAggregationData(prev, next) {
	            console.log("aggregations", prev, next)
	        }
	    }
	}
</script>
```
-   **aggregationSize**
    To set the number of buckets to be returned by aggregations.

    > Note: This is a new feature and only available for appbase versions >= 7.41.0.
-   **highlight** `boolean` [optional]
    whether highlighting should be enabled in the returned results.

-   **highlightField** `string or Array` [optional]
    when highlighting is enabled, this prop allows specifying the fields which should be returned with the matching highlights. When not specified, it defaults to applying highlights on the field(s) specified in the **dataField** prop.

-   **customHighlight** `Object` [optional]
    It can be used to set the custom highlight settings. You can read the `Elasticsearch` docs for the highlight options at [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-highlighting.html).

-   **categoryField** `string` [optional]
    Data field which has the category values mapped.

-   **categoryValue** `string` [optional]
    This is the selected category value. It is used for informing the search result.

-   **nestedField** `string`
    set the `nested` field path that allows an array of objects to be indexed in a way that can be queried independently of each other. Applicable only when dataField's mapping is of `nested` type.

-   **fuzziness** `string | number`
    Set a maximum edit distance on the search parameters, which can be 0, 1, 2, or "AUTO". This is useful for showing the correct results for an incorrect search parameter by taking the fuzziness into account. For example, with a substitution of one character, the fox can become a box.
    Read more about it in the elastic search [docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/fuzziness.html)

-   **enableSynonyms**: boolean
    This property can be used to control (enable/disable) the synonyms behavior for a particular query. Defaults to `true`, if set to `false` then fields having `.synonyms` suffix will not affect the query.

-   **searchOperators** `boolean`
    Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, then you can use special characters in the search query to enable the advanced search.<br/>
    Read more about it [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-simple-query-string-query.html).

-   **queryString** `boolean` [optional]
    Defaults to `false`. If set to `true` then it allows you to create a complex search that includes wildcard characters, searches across multiple fields, and more. Read more about it [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html).

-  **clearOnQueryChange** `boolean` [optional]
    Defaults to `true`, i.e. clear the component's input selection when the query of its dependent component changes (which is set via react prop). When set to `false`, the component's input selection isn't cleared.
-   **distinctField** `String` [optional]
	This prop returns only the distinct value documents for the specified field. It is equivalent to the `DISTINCT` clause in SQL. It internally uses the collapse feature of Elasticsearch. You can read more about it over [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/collapse-search-results.html).

-   **distinctFieldConfig** `Object` [optional]
	This prop allows specifying additional options to the `distinctField` prop. Using the allowed DSL, one can specify how to return K distinct values (default value of K=1), sort them by a specific order, or return a second level of distinct values. `distinctFieldConfig` object corresponds to the `inner_hits` key's DSL.  You can read more about it over [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/collapse-search-results.html).

```html
<search-box
	....
	distinctField="authors.keyword"
	:distinctFieldConfig="{
		inner_hits: {
			name: 'most_recent',
			size: 5,
			sort: [{ timestamp: 'asc' }],
		},
		max_concurrent_group_searches: 4,
	}"
/>
```

-   **value** `string` [optional]
    sets the current value of the component. It sets the search query text (on mount and on update). Use this prop in conjunction with the `onChange` prop to take the control of search input value.

-   **onChange** `function` [optional]
    is a callback function which accepts component's current **value** as a parameter. It is called when you are using the `value` prop and the component's value changes.

```html
<search-box
	:value="text"
	@change="(value, searchComponent, e) => {
		this.text = value;
		// To fetch suggestions
		searchComponent.triggerDefaultQuery();
		// To update results
		searchComponent.triggerCustomQuery();
	}"
/>
```

### To customize the AutoSuggestions

-   **enablePopularSuggestions** `Boolean`
    Defaults to `false`. When enabled, it can be useful to curate search suggestions based on actual search queries that your users are making. Read more about it over [here](/docs/analytics/popular-suggestions/).

-   **enableRecentSearches** `Boolean` Defaults to `false`. If set to `true` then users will see the top recent searches as the default suggestions. Appbase.io recommends defining a unique id(`userId` property) in `appbaseConfig` prop for each user to personalize the recent searches.
> Note: Please note that this feature only works when `recordAnalytics` is set to `true` in `appbaseConfig`.

-   **enablePredictiveSuggestions** `bool` [optional]
    Defaults to `false`. When set to `true`, it predicts the next relevant words from a field's value based on the search query typed by the user. When set to `false` (default), the entire field's value would be displayed. This may not be desirable for long-form fields (where average words per field value is greater than 4 and may not fit in a single line).

    ```ts
    // pass this prop as true in searchComponent to enable predictive suggestions
    :enablePredictiveSuggestions="true",
    ```

-   **showDistinctSuggestions** `Boolean` Show 1 suggestion per document. If set to `false` multiple suggestions may show up for the same document as
    searched value might appear in multiple fields of the same document, this is true only if you have configured multiple fields in `dataField` prop. Defaults to `true`.
    <br/> <br/>
    **Example** if you have `showDistinctSuggestions` is set to `false` and have following configurations

        ```js
        // Your document:
        {
            "name": "Warn",
            "address": "Washington"
        }
        // Component:
        <SearchBox dataField={['name', 'address']} />
        // Search Query:
        "wa"
        ```

    Then there will be 2 suggestions from the same document
    as we have the search term present in both the fields
    specified in `dataField`.

    ```
    Warn
    Washington
    ```

### To customize the SearchBox UI

-   **title** `string|JSX` set the title of the component to be shown in the UI.

-   **loader** `string|JSX` Display an optional loader while fetching the options

-   **placeholder** `string` set placeholder text to be shown in the component's input field. Defaults to "Search".

-   **showIcon** `Boolean` whether to display a search or custom icon in the input box. Defaults to `true`.

-   **iconPosition** `string` sets the position of the search icon. Can be set to either `left` or `right`. Defaults to `right`.

-   **icon** `JSX` set a custom search icon instead of the default 🔍

-   **showClear** `Boolean` show a clear text `X` icon. Defaults to `false`.

-   **clearIcon** `any` sets custom clear icon for the search input box

-   **autosuggest** `Boolean` set whether the autosuggest functionality should be enabled or disabled. Defaults to `true`.

-   **strictSelection** `Boolean` defaults to `false`. When set to `true`, the component will only set its value and fire the query if the value was selected from the suggestion. Otherwise the value will be cleared
    on selection. This is only relevant with `autosuggest`.

-   **defaultSuggestions** `suggestionsDef` preset search suggestions to be shown on focus when the SearchBox does not have any search query text set. Accepts an array of objects each having a **label** and **value** property. The label can contain either String or an HTML element. For an example

```jsx
<SearchBox
    defaultSuggestions={[
        {
            label: 'Songwriting',
            value: 'Songwriting'
        },
        {
            label: 'Musicians',
            value: 'Musicians'
        }
    ]}
>
```

-   **downShiftProps** `Object` are the props to be passed to `DownShift` for typeahead configurations

-   **debounce** `wholeNumber` delays executing the query by the specified time in **ms** while the user is typing. Defaults to `0`, i.e. no debounce. Useful if you want to save on the number of requests sent.

-   **showVoiceSearch** `Boolean` Enable voice search for searchbox

-   **focusShortcuts** `Array<string | number>` [optional]
A list of keyboard shortcuts that focus the search box. Accepts key names and key codes. Compatible with key combinations separated using '+'. Defaults to `['/']`.
> Note
>1. By default, pressing `'/'` would focus the search box.
>2. The `hotkeys-js` library needs to be installed manually when using combinations in `focusShortcuts` prop, eg: 'cmd+b', 'ctrl+q', etc, without which only single key shortcuts would work if passed in the prop, eg: From among ['/', 'b', '#', 'ctrl+r'], only '/', 'b', '#' would work without hotkey-js installation.

-   **autoFocus** `boolean` [optional] When set to true, search box is auto-focused on page load. Defaults to `false`.

- **expandSuggestionsContainer** `boolean` [optional] When set to false the width of suggestions dropdown container is limited to the width of searchbox input field. Defaults to `true`.
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/x3jF23m.png"/>

```jsx
 <search-box
        expandSuggestionsContainer={false}
        ...
  >
    <img slot="addonBefore" src="..." />
    <img slot="addonAfter" src="..." />
 </search-box>
```

### Customize style

-   **innerClass** `Object` `SearchBox` component supports an `innerClass` prop to provide styles to the sub-components of `SearchBox`. These are the supported keys:

    -   `title`
    -   `input`
    -   `list`

-   **className** `String`
    CSS class to be injected on the component container.

-   **style** `Object`
    CSS styles to be applied to the **SearchBox** component.

### To customize the query execution

-   **headers** `Object`
    set custom headers to be sent with each server request as key/value pairs. For example:

```html
<search-box
	id="search-component"
	:dataField="['original_title', 'original_title.search']"
	:headers="{
		secret: 'searchbase-is-awesome',
	}"
/>
```

-   **transformRequest** `(requestOptions: Object) => Promise<Object>`
    Enables transformation of network request before execution. This function will give you the request object as the param and expect an updated request in return, for execution.<br/>
    For example, we will add the `credentials` property in the request using `transformRequest`.

```html
<template>
	<search-box
		id="search-component"
		:dataField="['original_title', 'original_title.search']"
		:transformRequest="transformRequest"
	/>
</template>
<script>
	export default {
		name: 'App',
		methods: {
			transformRequest(request) {
				return Promise.resolve({
					...request,
					credentials: include,
				});
			},
		},
	};
</script>
```

-   **transformResponse** `(response: any) => Promise<any>`
    Enables transformation of search network response before rendering them. It is an asynchronous function which will accept an Elasticsearch response object as param and is expected to return an updated response as the return value.<br/>
    For example:

```html
<template>
	<search-box
		id="search-component"
		:dataField="['original_title', 'original_title.search']"
		:transformResponse="transformResponse"
	/>
</template>
<script>
	export default {
		name: 'App',
		methods: {
			async transformResponse(elasticsearchResponse) {
				const ids = elasticsearchResponse.hits.hits.map(item => item._id);
				const extraInformation = await getExtraInformation(ids);
				const hits = elasticsearchResponse.hits.hits.map(item => {
					const extraInformationItem = extraInformation.find(
						otherItem => otherItem._id === item._id,
					);
					return {
						...item,
						...extraInformationItem,
					};
				});

				return {
					...elasticsearchResponse,
					hits: {
						...elasticsearchResponse.hits,
						hits,
					},
				};
			},
		},
	};
</script>
```

> Note
>
> `transformResponse` function is expected to return data in the following structure.

```json
    {
        // Elasticsearch hits response
        hits: {
            hits: [...],
            total: 100
        },
        // Elasticsearch aggregations response
        aggregations: {

        }
        took: 1
    }
```

-   **defaultQuery**: `(component: SearchComponent) => Object`
    is a callback function that takes [SearchComponent](docs/reactivesearch/searchbase/overview/searchcomponent/) instance as parameter and **returns** the data query to be applied to the suggestions, as defined in Elasticsearch Query DSL, which doesn't get leaked to other components. In simple words, `defaultQuery` is used with data-driven components to impact their own data.

    For example, set the `timeout` to `1s` for suggestion query.

```html
<template>
	<search-box
		id="search-component"
		:dataField="['original_title', 'original_title.search']"
		:defaultQuery="defaultQuery"
	/>
</template>
<script>
	export default App {
	    name: 'App',
	    methods: {
	        defaultQuery() {
	            return {
	                "timeout": "1s"
	            }
	        }
	    }
	}
</script>
```

-   **customQuery**: `(component: SearchComponent) => Object`
    takes [SearchComponent](docs/reactivesearch/searchbase/overview/searchcomponent/) instance as parameter and **returns** the query to be applied to the dependent components by `react` prop, as defined in Elasticsearch Query DSL.

    For example, the following example has two components `search-component`(to render the suggestions) and `result-component`(to render the results). The `result-component` depends on the `search-component` to update the results based on the selected suggestion. The `search-component` has the `customQuery` prop defined that will not affect the query for suggestions(that is how `customQuery` is different from `defaultQuery`) but it'll affect the query for `result-component` because of the `react` dependency on `search-component`.

```html
<template>
	<search-base
		index="gitxplore-app"
		url="https://@arc-cluster-appbase-demo-6pjy6z.searchbase.io"
		credentials="a03a1cb71321:75b6603d-9456-4a5a-af6b-a487b309eb61"
	>
		<search-box
			id="search-component"
			:dataField="['original_title', 'original_title.search']"
			:customQuery="customQuery"
		/>
		<search-component
			id="result-component"
			dataField="original_title"
			:react="{
                and: ['search-component']
            }"
		/>
	</search-base>
</template>
<script>
	export default App {
	    name: 'App',
	    methods: {
	        customQuery() {
	            return {
	                timeout: '1s',
	                query: {
	                    match_phrase_prefix: {
	                        fieldName: {
	                            query: 'hello world',
	                            max_expansions: 10,
	                        },
	                    },
	                },
	            }
	        }
	    }
	}
</script>
```

### Miscellaneous

-   **getMicInstance** `Function` You can pass a callback function to get the instance of `SpeechRecognition` object, which can be used to override the default configurations for voice search.

-   **beforeValueChange** `Function`
    is a callback function which accepts component's future **value** as a parameter and **returns** a promise. It is called every-time before a component's value changes. The promise, if and when resolved, triggers the execution of the component's query and if rejected, kills the query execution. This method can act as a gatekeeper for query execution, since it only executes the query after the provided promise has been resolved.
    For example:

```html
<template>
	<search-box
		id="search-component"
		:dataField="['original_title', 'original_title.search']"
		:beforeValueChange="beforeValueChange"
	/>
</template>
<script>
	export default App {
	    name: 'App',
	    methods: {
	        beforeValueChange(value) {
	            // called before the value is set
	            // returns a promise
	            return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
	                // update state or component props
	                resolve();
	                // or reject()
	            });
	        }
	    }
	}
</script>
```

-   **URLParams** `Boolean` enable creating a URL query string param based on the search query text value. This is useful for sharing URLs with the component state. Defaults to `false`.

-   **defaultValue** `string` set the initial search query text on mount.

-   **subscribeTo** `Array<string>` lets you subscribe to various Searchbox properties to render UI (or to create a side-effect) based on changes to the properties.
<br/>
These are the properties that can be subscribed to:

    -   `results`   
    -   `aggregationData`
    -   `requestStatus`
    -   `error`
    -   `value`
    -   `query`
    -   `micStatus`
    -   `dataField`
    -   `size`
    -   `from`
    -   `fuzziness`
    -   `includeFields`
    -   `excludeFields`
    -   `sortBy`
    -   `react`
    -   `defaultQuery`
    -   `customQuery`
## Events

-   **valueChange** is an event which accepts component's current **value** as a parameter. It is called every-time the component's value changes. This prop is handy in cases where you want to generate a side-effect on value selection. For example: You want to show a pop-up modal with the valid discount coupon code when a user searches for a product in a SearchBox.

-   **valueSelected** An event which gets triggered on selecting a value from suggestions

-   **error** gets triggered in case of an error while fetching suggestions
