This guide provides an overview of using Searchbox and ReactiveSearch UI libraries with Atlas Search.

## ReactiveSearch Realm Project

The ReactiveSearch Realm project deploys the ReactiveSearch API as a transpiled JS code into a Realm function. The goal of this project is to enable Atlas Search users to be able to build search UIs using [Searchbox](https://opensource.appbase.io/searchbox) and [ReactiveSearch](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactivesearch) UI libraries.

> **Note on current project status:** This project is being actively developed and currently in a MVP stage where Atlas Search users can deploy the Realm function and run it with the React Searchbox library. Follow the below guides to get started and test this.

### Getting Started

Start with deploying this project as a [Realm function](/docs/reactivesearch/atlas-search/deploy/) in your MongoDB environment.


### Test with Search UIs

Test the deployed Realm function with a React UI over [here](/docs/reactivesearch/atlas-search/search-examples-with-react/) or with Vue UI over [here](/docs/reactivesearch/atlas-search/search-examples-with-vue/).

### Search Use Cases with REST API examples

Run different search use-cases with the deployed Realm function's REST API directly over [here](/docs/reactivesearch/atlas-search/search-examples/).
