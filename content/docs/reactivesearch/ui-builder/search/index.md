## Overview


[ReactiveSearch.io](http://reactivesearch.io)'s **UI Builder** is a built-in visual search UI builder that enables citizen developers to author search UIs with point and click, extend or export the resulting codebase. It comes with version control support and each version can be deployed on the global edge with your domain in a single click.

You can following this Arcade to see how the UI builder works.

> Note: **UI Builder** feature is available for all ReactiveSearch plans.


### Pick A Template

UI builder currently comes with 6 different templates for React and 1 template for Vue.

The templates are divided into three categories:

1. **Enterprise Search UIs** - Enterprise search UI templates come with end-user authentication support and also support showing analytics, charts.

2. **E-commerce Search** - E-commerce search UI templates are focused on speed and come in two flavors: a search page only faceted search template that is ideal to integrate into your e-commerce store front and a multi-page search template that comes with a home page, search page, and a detailed page view for each item which is more suited when you're publishing the entire search UI.

3. **Geo Search** - There is one geo-search template that shows how to render an OpenStreetMap / GoogleMap to show search results with faceting on a map.


### UI components

The search UI builder allows adding all the major components of the ReactiveSearch UI components.

In this interactive demo, we will show how you can add UI components with the search UI builder across multiple pages, tweak results, add end-user authentication and deploy the search UI on your own custom domain ðŸª„

### End-user Authentication

You can configure end-user authentication with Username / Password and OAuth with Google.

When configuring username/password authentication, you can optionally choose to enable user sign-ups or manage your end-users with the User Management Portal from within the dashboard.

> Note: This feature is only available for Production and Enterprise plan users

You can configure end-user authentication with Enterprise providers like SAML or AD.

> Note: This feature is only available for Enterprise plan users

### Custom Domain

You can publish the search UI to your own domain. Publishing your search UI live to your domain requires you to add DNS TXT and CNAME records.

You can add filters for either:
1. **List** (good for text data that needs to be shown as facets),
2. **Range** (good for displaying price or other numeric information as facets), or 
3. **Date** (good for displaying date information)

MultiList, SingleList, TagCloud, SingleDataList, RangeInput, and DateRange are the supported Facet types within the UI builder.

#### Charts

#### Custom Messages

Custom Messages tab lets you customize the text and messaging that appears at various points of the search journey for E-Commerce visitors. You can customize these messages.

![Custom Messages](https://i.imgur.com/vgw0Yii.png)

- **Search Text** lets you set the placeholder message in the search box,
- You can set a custom **Search Icon**,
- **Suggestions Loading** is the message that appears in the search dropdown when relevant suggestions are being fetched,
- **No Suggestions Found** lets you set the message when no suggestions are found for a search term,
- **Result Stats** message lets you show how many results were found for the search query along with the time taken,
- **No Results Found** lets you set the message that appears on the search results page when a search query returns no results,
- **No Filter Items** lets you set the message that appears the filters that appears when there are no relevant filters to select from
- **Fetching Filter Items** lets you set the message when the filter values are being fetched.

While some of these messages are on-screen for a brief period of time, it is considered a good Ux practice to have them set up. They can be used to guide your users to finding relevant search results.

### Edit Code Inline

Starting December 2022, you can edit your saved search configuration inline in a cloud IDE.

The IDE provides a live transpilation where you can edit the code and see live results. This is ideal when you're extending the code to add your own UI components, pages, and such.

![](https://i.imgur.com/kjqlU8x.png)

The IDE changes are reflected back to the no-code panel and any changes done via no-code are also reflected into the IDE. This happens as every change you save is version controled. You can commit your changes, and each version gets deployed to its own domain.

You can also export the resulting code by first exporting it to Code.


### Export Code And Native Development

For production and enterprise plan users, we support exporting of the code functionality. You can go to the code editor first, then go to export to CodeSandbox and from there, you can download the ZIPs.

You can develop with your favorite IDE such as Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and then choose to re-import the project back to the UI builder as well.
