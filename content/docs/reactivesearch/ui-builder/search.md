### E-Commerce Platform

![Choose Platform](https://imgur.com/DWhvlhp.png)

You can choose the `E-Commerce Platform` for which you are building the search UI for. The Shopify option comes with presets specific to Shopify's schema. You can also import data from a Shopify store into appbase.io via the `Develop > Import` tab. However, you can use UI Builder to build a site search for other platforms such as Magento, Wordpress, Webflow, Wix and it can even be integrated into your own site.

### Importing Data

appbase.io natively supports indexing data from a Shopify store via our dashboard.

You can read more about the different preferences and how it works over [here](/docs/data/import/from-shopify/).

### Layout and Design

The options in the `Layout and Design` tab will let you style and create a design for your search results and search results page.

![Search Layout](https://imgur.com/fgxvpxh.png)

Starting with the `Search Layout` tab, you can select the overall look for your search page. Currently, you can select `Classic`, which has clearly defined boxes for filters and facets making it a great fit for multi-category stores, or `Minimal` which delivers a streamlined view preferred by fashion and jewelery retailers.

The next tab, `Style Presets`, will let you set the font family and color preferences for the storefront search.

In `Custom CSS`, you will be able to set your CSS to control the look and feel of the search results page on a more granular level by adding various classes. We've also given some examples you copy-paste in the editor. All these changes will be updated in realtime and you can have a look at them in the preview.

### Search Settings

In the `Search Settings` tab, you will be able to define the behavior for search, filters, and results.

Custom Messages tab lets you customize the text and messaging that appears at various points of the search journey for E-Commerce visitors. You can customize these messages.
