## Why Searchbox?

Your Searchbar is the most powerful widget on your site! Offer a SoTA search Ux similar to Spotlight, Chrome, Google, Amazon by integrating search, navigation and the ability to run custom JavaScript functions from right within your searchbar.

1. A search bar helps you understand what people want from you

Almost all the search engines perform analytics based on the queries entered by the user in the search bar, based on the query analytics the service providers can optimize the services they provide, effectively reducing the bounce back.

2. Search bars help visitors find what they need, faster

A search bar on your website will let your visitors find what they are looking for faster.

- It makes your website visitors happy. They needed something, they found it, and they are more likely to come back to your website the next time they need something in your area of expertise. 

3. A search bar can keep visitors on your site longer

This might sound counter-intuitive to the reason above but it’s actually not. 

**Scenario 1**: A visitor lands on your website and after a quick glance and maybe a half-scroll, they don’t see what they need. They are likely to move on to the next Google search result and try again.

**Scenario 2**: A visitor lands on your website and after a quick glance and maybe a half-scroll, they don’t see what they need. Instead of leaving though, they spot your search bar. Now, they spend time using the search bar, reviewing results, and navigating over to a new page or two. 

## Beyond Search Box

Use cases for using the searchbox component in your application:

- In-app navigation: Offer an in-app navigation experience through your searchbar allowing users to navigate through your site or dashboard without needing to jump between multiple menus, or relying on header/footer navigations.

- Onboarding of new users: New users who are not familiar with the product or how to use it can just go to the search bar and search for the documentation of the product or search for help if needed. Through the in-app navigation, a user can search for frequently asked questions and navigate to the page effortlessly.

- User productivity with actions: When actions like toggling between light mode or dark mode of your app can be done directly from the search bar, it can further enhance the search user experience.
