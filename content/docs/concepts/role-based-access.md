## Introduction

Esential entities in any [Role Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) system are the **user**, the **service** that user wants to access (in our case *appbase application / elasticsearch indexes*), and the **[identity provider (IdP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider)**. To access the service, the user first needs to authenticate against the IdP. The IdP verifies the user credentials and hands out a signed token. The user then sends this token to the service with each request. The service uses the information in the token to verify the userâ€™s identity and to assign roles and permissions.

You can now secure your Appbase applications by providing role based access to the various users that are going to use appbase application / elasticsearch index. We are supporting role base access using [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/introduction/).
> JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

You can add JWT token with `Authorization: Bearer {JWT}` header, to authorize a user. In order verify JWT token from different identity providers, we decide to support the JWT tokens that are signed using public/private key pair using [RSA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)).

Now with the `JWT Bearer` token authorization, we will not be exposing our api crendentials, hence adding one more layer of security to the application.

## Enable Role Based Access using Dashboard

Appbase dasbhaord provides an intutive way to enable and configure role based access using JWT. In order to setup RBAC, select `Role Based Access` under `Security` on Dashboard's navigation bar.

### This page is divided into 2 sections

#### 1. Configuring JWT Public Key and Role Key
In order to verify JWT token signed using RSA256, we need a Public Key provided by the identity provider. You can simple paste the public key in text area provided for `Public Key`. Another thing that is required to verify role, is actual `Role Key` that would be present in any JWT token. This can be configured in `Role Key` input. Default value for role key is `role`.

**Here is a quick example, where [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/) is used as identity provider.**

#### 2. Adding roles to [API Credentials](/concepts/api-credentials.html)
Once the `Public Key` and `Role Key` are configured, you can setup the actual roles that a user can have in your application in `Map Roles to API Credential` section. Each crendentials created in [API Credentials](/concepts/api-credentials.html) section can have unique role name, which would be the value encoded in our JWT token.

As you can see in the above example we have 2 roles assigned to different credentials, i.e. `admin` & `developer` (*this values have to be unique per application*).

Now when ever a user will make request to application, with valid `JWT Bearer` token for a given application he/she will be able to access the data.

Sample API call for appbase app

```bash
curl --location --request GET "https://scalr.api.appbase.io/my-appbase-app" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Impob24iLCJyb2xlIjoiYWRtaW4ifQ.GEbnh5dfbdRXdlkGi5aLFnM7xYuYViPSf0ZnLGaX0ikfo3fT8Rtx7rbpKvR6_eftmB3q0Q_x3n9-JsgbEY1E47p2H_qhMhP5Jd8uB__Dlm1LW5W6qiDsNelVsZLAcqq-CgnGxkgWvWRFfpNEoyZhzLa3TudoPjZWW7m4WOaewpyZwlyGH7oztjbLVwRVCNC5ziA61aZJHVR-C4MhaMxZ-hf1uE022BD9q6aH-mWuVjbMACMOQuqTgIxo5tmphRh_kbuKZEUslUYtB1cEPzgQNU2eRq5BjDI4EoxdTKkLhgYSgMWNnUcZowq8sd4-kKjEB7wrUa6xYIjY04xVO4NvYw"
